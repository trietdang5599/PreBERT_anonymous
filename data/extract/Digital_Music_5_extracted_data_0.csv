A39P9MWS8L0FZH,B001EWT040,1,1,5,"The song ""Shut Up And Let Me Go"" by The Ting Tings is my favorite song of 2008. I like the disco-rock guitar beat as well as the various other cool sounds in the song. I had never heard of this band before this song, so I don't know anything about them. I think this may be classified as DANCE MUSIC. But I'm 52 years old and I played it non-stop for 3 weeks after I first heard it. Very infectious beat. I would like more music like this. As a whole I don't like much newer music, but I sure do love this song.","And Let Me Go "" by The Ting Tings is my favorite song of 2008 .

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B0108UP0EC,1,1,5,"I normally despise remakes of my favorite songs.  Invariably, they lose something of the charm of the original when updated and translated to a modern musician's style.  Whether it's Madonna remaking Don McLean's ""American Pie,"" Destiny's Child remaking Roberta Flack's ""Killing Me Softly With His Song,"" or the Dixie Chicks' remaking Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide,"" it always feels to me like the new versions are little more than watered-down copies of the originals, annoying at best and downright soulless at worst.  So when a video of Simon and Garfunkle's classic ""Sound of Silence"" being performed by metal/rock band Disturbed began circulating on Facebook, I braced myself for the worst.  The only thing worse than a modern remake of ""Sound of Silence,"" I thought, would be a metal cover of it.

I was blown away.  No, Disturbed's version of ""Sound of Silence"" doesn't have the same tone and quiet thoughtfulness of Simon and Garfunkle's song.  But instead of giving us a weak copy, Disturbed gives us something powerful and resonant, a cover that is unique and excellent, even masterful, in its own right.

""Sound of Silence"" is a slow, melancholy ballad, but while S&G made it thoughtful and wistful, Disturbed infuses it with a great sense of sadness and even rage that slowly builds to an ultimately hopeful crescendo.  It makes for a haunting, yet in the end thrilling, listening experience.  The singer's voice struggles a bit with some of the higher notes but otherwise has a rich and even gorgeous tone, carrying a great deal of emotion as he sings.  And despite Disturbed being mostly known for harder stuff like metal and hard rock, they don't spoil this cover with unnecessary guitar riffs or drum-bashing -- the instrumentation is mostly subdued and provides haunting accompaniment, though it apes the singer by building to a thundering, powerful crescendo in the end.  A good song has singer and accompaniment working together rather than fighting one another, and ""Sound of Silence"" delivers.

Disturbed didn't change a single lyric of the song in the process of covering it, which I greatly appreciate.  Sometimes covers take advantage of the song they're remaking by altering the lyrics, and this rarely works out for the best in my mind.  Disturbed made a good call by keeping all the original lyrics in place -- their message of a society where people are afraid to speak out or listen to the ugly but necessary truth is still resonant today, and is a message that needs heard now more than ever.

I still love Simon and Garfunkle's version of this song... but Disturbed's cover is amazing, and one of the few song covers that I would call just as good as the original.  Disturbed takes a well-known and well-loved song and makes it their own without weakening it at all, and I highly recommend it even to those who aren't fond of the band or their style of music.  You won't be disappointed.","I normally despise remakes of my favorite songs . Invariably , they lose something of the charm of the original and translated to a modern musician 's style .

A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel...and how would that work out?  It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well.  I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and didn't find the need to go back to this as this style of music and production doesn't fit her folksy shape and leanings.  A big part of her draw is her earthy, grounded guitar and other natural instrumental sounds; you won't find much of that here.  This synth-pop-techno music strips away some of her soul.  Still, even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever, even beneath and through so much digitization.

1) Stand: it's okay.  Starting us off with Jewel's voice front and center as uninspired, syncopated beats and some buzzes chirp here and there.  ""Reach"" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well.
2) Run 2 U: her lovely,soft voice saves a song without musical importance.
3) Intuition: Singing twice and three times over her own voice and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this otherwise forgettable piece.
4) Leave the Lights On: Now here's something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds and a bluesy style.  Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far.
5) 2 Find U: Weak.
6) Fragile Heart: A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked.  Too slow, though.
7) Doin' Fine: ""We are what everyone wants to be.""  We are doin' fine.  Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay.
8) 2 Become 1: The music is much more engaging and natural.  This feels like a Jewel song and could be on any one of her albums (minus the way she is ""spells"" the song title...).
9) Haunted: A seductive and creepy song.  Totally cool and different.  Uh, and kinda sensuous.  Jewel's moaning at the end of the song is...well, let's just say that I'm glad that it doesn't go on too long.
10) Sweet Temptation: Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs.
11) Yes U Can: This one might just make you dance.  Again, a love and sex song that is both a joinder and a cautious observation.  It is minorly infectious.
12) U & Me = Love: Dance pop bubblegum fluff.  Blech.
13) America: Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed.  It's okay, unless you're tired of hearing popsters and others bagging on America.  Not nearly one of her best social observation songs (probably because it's so politicized).
14) Becoming: Lyrically well-suited to the empty dance-pop genre, Jewel witnesses her own ""becoming"" with her heart.  Ahhh, isn't that nice.  Maudlin stuff.

As you might have guessed this isn't my favorite Jewel album.  But there is at least one gem on here and a few other songs that work.  If you're interested in what Jewel has to offer I'd highly suggest starting elsewhere (personally, I'd direct you to ""This Way"") and if you like your techno-dance-pop I'd look somewhere else too.","that I was getting something different with this Jewel ... that work out ?

AV648VU7JR5D5,B000V66LEC,1,1,5,"'Everything is everything.' I love the friendly chatter that opens this sweet tune. What's Going On was co-written by Renaldo 'Obie' Benson, a member of the Four Tops, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland, and Marvin Gaye. Benson had witnessed police brutality in Berkeley and was really shook up by it. He began to ask himself all sorts of questions, like why were kids being sent off to Vietnam? and why were kids being beaten at home? Marvin Gaye was asking himself, with all the problems going on in my country, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs? The song is a plea for people to talk with each other and explore alternatives to war and violence. 'For only love can conquer hate.' It's amazing to me that this song is still relevant all these years later. Will our world ever evolve to the kind of existence that everyone can enjoy?

Musically, I've always loved the drums. Marvin Gaye played a box drum accompaniment to the regular drums, producing this oversized ping pong ball quality. The saxophone opening is a classic. The legendary James Jamerson played the bass while laying on the floor. Excellent string arrangement.","I love the friendly chatter that opens this sweet tune .

A2IHB3M0ZIKNOZ,B000TE5LWE,1,1,5,"The Theme from Route 66 by Nelson Riddle is now better known than the show for which it was composed and has become a classic. It also has the rare honor of becoming a hit single by public demand, not being released until September of '62, while the show had been on the air since September of '60. People simply wanted it.

It's a remarkable piece, flinging you right into the scene, the bass being the rhythmic feeling of the road itself, the piano the breeze in your hair, the strings your soaring emotions as you cruise down the fabled highway. The middle section suggests night , as the music gets jazzier with a muted trumpet  that echoes Bobby Troup's song immortalized by the Nat King Cole Trio in the version on his After Midnight LP, perhaps pulling over to a local jazz club and all that could happen there at night on Route 66. Then the main theme picks up and you're on your way again.

Another aspect of the Theme is it's timing, being popular in the late Fifties and early Sixties, a time of great prosperity and optimism in the country. The Theme is full of confidence and brassy crescendos that seem, at least in retrospect, to sum up the feeling of a country that for a glorious moment felt it was doing everything right and on top of the world.

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B009IFYYIC,1,-1,3,"You know you've seen them. You know what I'm talking about. You know the men who look slightly off because there is something just slightly askew about their appearance. You know, the men who should be graying, but they're still trying to look young, and so they dye their hair a dark color and it makes them look odd and pasty? Well, that's ""Songs for the End of the World"" and Rick Springfield at this point.

Something is just off. Why doesn't Rick look 63? Why does his music sound like it's for kids? Oh sure, he's adapted, unfortunately he's adapted to Blink 182, Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco, and all the other bland trendy emo/punk bands of the last decade. Now sure, Rick rocks and he rolls, but he just doesn't bring the hooks and melodies. He gussies his songs up and tries to knock your socks off, but it just comes off like some kind of weird overcompensation. Like someone who is trying really really hard to sound hip and not old.

And this bothers me. You see, Lindsey Buckingham, Tom Waits and Bruce Springsteen were also all born in 1949 just like Rick. If you listen to each of their last albums you will hear (and see) that they have aged gracefully, doing their own thing, not trying to go with the trends, and they all still bring the hooks and melodies and (look their age) and sound respectable. But Rick here, well, you see, he's like that guy I was talking about earlier--the guy who is old but pretends to be young and it doesn't work (or look quite right).

My first Springfield cassette was 1984's ""Hard to Hold"", and I've stuck with him ever since. But you know, when I went back and listened to all of the albums I own leading up to this new release, the one thing I came away with is that Rick is more of a singles guy rather than an album guy. Every album of his has some really good tracks rounded out with filler. ""Songs for the End of the World"" is no different.

In fact, the strongest songs are at the front with ""Wide Awake"", ""Our Ship's Sinking"" and ""I Hate Myself"" being the best songs on the entire disc. I suppose ""Gabriel"" is decent, and maybe ""You & Me"". I liked ""One Way Street"", but all I could think about is how the guitar intro comes dangerously close to The Who's ""Pinball Wizard"". And again, although Rick has updated his sound, he has now churned out the same album at least three times--2004's ""Shock/Denial/Anger/Acceptance"" and 2008's ""Venus in Overdrive"" and now ""Songs"". And although I've enjoyed Rick's output since 1999, the honest truth is (and you know it's True if you're being honest with yourself here) that Rick's best work was with RCA. You know 1981 to 1988. That was when he was at his best. From 1999 to 2012, well that's just Rick keeping pace and sounding (and looking) slightly off.

I believe Rick has one great album left in him, but will he dispense with this emo/punk/pop sheen that he thinks will keep him younger, and just go for it. Just give us the power pop snyth/guitar melodies that made his 1980s work so good. He can just update the instruments.

Obviously Rick still has some rabid fans because five stars for ""Songs"" is just not possible. It isn't five stars, and it isn't the best album of his career. Like most of his recent work it's just good. Also, the gimmick of using your iPhone application to recognize photos on the insert is kind of cheesy. I did it, and the extra content did not impress me, and there wasn't that much.

I'm going to be the lone voice of reason here and take the heat by saying that it's okay Rick, you can age now, you can give us what we want--your gray hair and pop melodies that actually sound like you and not the band of the moment. It's okay to show some wrinkles and fat, you've earned it. It's okay to make more than one or two hits per album. I give you my permission to make a 12 song or 10 song set that will stand as your Sgt. Peppers.

It's also okay to not make every song sound almost the same as the next, a problem I found with ""Songs"".

Also, isn't it about time someone did something about the Springfield catalog? I mean, where's the digitally remastered catalog with bonus tracks or bonus discs? Heck, where's Rick's first five albums from the 1970s? Terribly hard to find in compact disc except for a few. ""Wait for Night"" and ""Beautiful Feelings"" near impossible to find on compact disc. Will we ever get to hear the original ""Beautiful Feelings"" or will it remain just the 1984 re-recordings?

Here's how ""Songs for the End of the World"" compares to Rick's other works:

A1ALPL858XSDE,B000WLIE7I,1,1,4,"Hallelujah!  George Strait and MCA have finally released a single-disc collection of hits that isn't skimpy!  Unlike Strait's previous three sets that were made up of ten prior hits, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is comprised of fifteen tracks, of which two are new recordings.  Specifically, it picks up where the multi-disc retrospective Strait Out Of  The Box leaves off, with the old hits culled from Strait's 1994 through  1998 albums.
 While more extensive, this anthology is far from  perfect however.  ""Lead On"" and ""King Of The Mountain"" (the latter barely  scraped into the top 20) drag along unmelodically and are slower than  molasses.  Some of the other singles seem like rewrites of old Strait hits  (""I Can Still Make Cheyenne"" recalling ""Amarillo By Morning"" and  ""Adalida""  bringing to mind ""The Love Bug"").  With ""Carrying Your Love With Me"" and  ""Carried Away,"" Strait even repeats himself within the same collection.
  If you think I am getting too nit-picky about this set, you may be right.  The crisp, heartfelt delivery on ""You Can't Make A Heart Love Somebody"" is  just one example of why many consider Strait to be the Sinatra of country  music.  And as ""Blue Clear Sky"" and ""Round About Way"" illustrate, no one  handles a play-on-words more effectively than Strait.  You'd also be  hard-pressed to find country music more riproaringly enjoyable than ""We  Really Shouldn't Be Doing This.""
 The two new singles contribute in  mixed degrees to the Strait legacy.  Recent chart-topper ""The Best Day"" is  nice, but it also seems too similar to some old hits (""Love Without End,  Amen,"" ""Check Yes Or No).""  Here our protagonist progresses through a love  for camping, cars, and finally, his ideal woman.  Much better is ""Murder On  Music Row,"" a duet with Alan Jackson.  This mega-event pairing of two of  modern country's most traditional (and successful) artists is an  effectively acidic lament on the predominantly pop sound of today's  country....
 As  noted earlier, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is not flawless.  In light of  its several strong points, however, it has to be recommended as a must buy  for all country music listeners.","Hallelujah ! that is not skimpy ! that were made up of ten prior hits , Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is comprised of fifteen tracks , of While more extensive , this anthology is far from   perfect "" Lead On "" and "" King Of The Mountain "" ( the latter barely   scraped into the top 20 ) drag along unmelodically and are slower than   molasses .

I haven't listened to Bonnie Raitt in probably 20 years. I wasn't inclined to try this new album when Amazon kept telling me to try it every single day . But Amazon wore me down and I tried it....

And then I listened to it twice in a row!

I'm pretty sure Bonnie Raitt's voice has gotten better over the years. The slightly raspy tone is a perfect match for the set list on this album. Her band is great. Make sure you are listening on speakers or a headset that handles bass well because the band has a strong bass drum beat that gives the music energy.

Her cover of INXS's 'Need You Tonight' is fantastic. Just fantastic. I didn't recognize what it was it at first, but then started saying ""This sounds familiar...."" and then suddenly ""Oh wow!!"" It's a bluesy take on a 80's pop song. And she owns it!!!

She brings things down a notch for a softer melody in 'Undone'. It's a very peaceful, soothing sound with deep lyrics. This was one of my favorites off the album.

""The Ones We Couldn't Be"" is a very sad song but so beautifully done that you can't help but want to hear it again.

Most of the album is up tempo and jammin' though. It's a great listen.

I've never seen Bonnie Raitt in concert, but I've got a strong feeling that it's a pretty kickin' show. You just get that feeling listening to this album.

When you listen to this, the main theme of the music is FUN. This is roll down the windows, crank it up, sing along, songs.

The best songs are the ones that incorporate rock structure and pop culture.  ""Its Tricky"", ""Can you rock it like that"", ""My adidas"", ""Mary, Mary"" and ""You be Illin"" are great.

The highlight is ""Walk this Way"". They took a song that was essentially a predecessor to rap and made it even more funky.

A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B001IAQVZE,1,1,5,"Jim Croce was a singer/songwriter/guitarist from Philadelphia who burst onto the scene in the summer of 1973 with a #1 single ""You Don't Mess Around With Jim"".  Jim achieved his success the old fashioned way.  During the day he drove a truck and swung a hammer to support his young family and at night he played his music at bars and clubs all over Philly.  His first three singles all made the national Top 40 and in then in the spring of 1973 his 4th release ""Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"" would become his first #1 hit.  It appeared for all the world that Jim Croce was going to be a fixture on the American music scene for a very long time.  Here was an artist that the average Joe could relate to and root for.

Then on September 20, 1973 tragedy struck.  Jim Croce was killed in a plane crash in Natchitoches, LA.  He was just 30 years old.  Jim Croce had a backlog of unreleased material in the can and his label ABC continued to release a new single every few months.  His final Top Ten hit was released in February of 1974.  While I loved all of his singles I think ""I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song"" is my favorite.  The song spent 14 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart peaking at #9.  This is the original hit single recording you would remember from the radio.","who burst onto the scene in the summer of 1973 with a # 1 single "" You Do not Mess Around With Jim "" .

In two ways, I was wrong:

Radio played it quite a bit and once my mother got a hold of this song, she really, really, REALLY did NOT let go. She played it a lot and it grated on my nerves so bad, I started to ""hate"" this girl.

But fast forward some time and I say this is a good song made great because of the vocal force and runs that were perfected to a tee. Some say the lyrics are a bit juvenile and they kinda are overall, but the voice really does carry it over in this case.

The music to the song is good too but it doesn't compare to Lions, Tigers & Bears which also has better lyrics. If you have yet to hear it and have been ignoring radio, that's a good thing. But it's a bad thing if you haven't heard said song.

Find it somewhere and dig in.

A23OB9FM3MUYXT,B00137ILRS,1,1,5,"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad ""Total Eclipse of the Heart""; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.

Suffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.

""And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say

Having said that it is a strong album and a great listen. I'll admit I had to give it a few spins to get into it. Their previous album ""The Reason Why"" and their breakthrough ""The Road To Here"" remain my favorites. Wasn't a big fan of ""Pontoon"" when it was released earlier this year, but it is catchy and has grown on me. The stand out tracks on ""Tornado"" are ""Sober"", ""Your Side Of The Bed"", ""Can't Go Back"" and ""Night Owl"". The best thing about the album and Little Big Town are their harmonies. A very good album overall, but way too short especially when compared to their previous releases.","that it is a strong album and a great listen .

A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B014CJFN92,1,1,4,"Im going to start off by saying that I was underwhelmed by Part I.  It lacked a visceral quality; it was very symphonic but it lacked punch and exciting flourish.  Part II is more of the same, but it is better (I think).  While still very symphonic it also puts more emphasis into its punch, its bite.  The guitar work is more present (or at least more obvious to my ears) and a lot more driving than in Part I.  But I discovered a curious thing while listening through the album several times.  When I listened to the album as a whole I thought it was okay to good but still not really great.  Maybe there still wasn't enough distinctiveness between the songs for me to hang my standout moments or tracks on, or maybe the songs blurred together too much.  Whatever it was I still came away from the experiences not feeling fulfilled or whatever I was looking to feel by this release.  But when I listened to the release song by song, focusing on each song individually instead of part of the whole, I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this album a whole lot more.  Godmakers Temptation is a classic VP sound, an engaging track, and part of the first half of this release.  The following song Stone Roses Edge breaks into a gallop early on with some delicious guitars and nice keys surrounding them and filling them out, a heavy beat upping the intensity.  The first half of this release is pretty solid in fact.  Where I found myself losing interest or felt that the songs lost either energy or had an unfortunate blending was toward the end of the release.  And I think thats why this was so hard for me to really get into, because the first track (vision eleven as part of the Chronicles story) didn't immediately grab but the following three or four tacks did and then there were about three where the car slowed down before ending pretty well.  Symphonic metal fans, metal fans who like large religiously-tinged fantasy stories, and I suppose VD fans all will be satiated by Netherworld Part II.  For me, I will hope that they strip their sound down at points, and separate their flourishes on their next outing.  3.75 stars.","It lacked a visceral quality ; it was very symphonic but it lacked punch and exciting flourish . but it is better ( I think ) .

I did appreciate ""Just Fine"" a little more than when I did initially. ""Grown Woman"" I love and ""Work that"" picked up where the hidden track from her last album left off. The beat is nice, the lyrics are little B-rate. After ""Just Fine"" things start to run together and sound a bit same, then you run into the second half of the cd where things pick up a little. Her duet with Usher ""Shake down"" is cute but a bit odd vocally. Usher is nice but I would've imagined somebody with a more grown type of voice to complement Mary's (i.e Jahiem or Brian Mcknight).

A184D2E4QAM69B,B00SYTTBMC,1,1,4,"The Shakes' last recording was pretty impressive, and presumably very successful, as the many studio manipulations employed on ""Sound and Color"" surely made production expensive. At the same time, this talented band cuts through the manipulations here and there, and midway on the album are 3 or 4 dynamite songs, a couple with faster tempo, that show the better side of the Shakes, I think. In fact, the second half of the record is better than the first half.

Their last album ""Boys and Girls"" is pretty organic soul and blues influenced music with a unique Shakes twist, and hints of the 70s bluesy rock of Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company. I was really looking forward to this new issue, being a bit disappointed initially. But the essence of this core sound still comes through with patient listening. I'd suggest cutting to track 6 a few times and listening through. But for my taste, production is far too heavy-handed in most of the first half, and is too remote from the organic core that makes the Shakes an exceptional group.

But looking at it from this end of the stereo needle is much different from the conceptualizing, writing and recording end, and it has to be a challenge to develop a unique sound as a band, and particularly as a blues/rock band, to stay fresh and not become predictable and staid. The last recording by the Black Keys is also heavy on the production effects to the point of obscuring their sound, but after much listening, I'd say it's outstanding. Presumably production capabilities have grown by leaps and bounds, as this seems to be a trend currently.

So, there's some good stuff on ""Sounds and Color"", and hopefully this daring jump into electronica helps them find more inspiration and helps refine a somewhat different identity that is still a showcase for their talent, and doesn't sublimate it in a blur of electronic loops and echoes. I feel no need to have all my favorite bands transition to music from outerspace. Some of us just crave unique and powerful rock and roll, a sound that's Earth-born, and helps keep it turning.","The Shakes ' last recording was pretty impressive , and presumably very successful , as the many studio manipulations employed on "" Sound and Color "" surely made production expensive .

A1FML9FCUPV6TI,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"So this is Jewel. I was surprised when I saw the album cover a few months ago. Slowly but surely ""Intuition"" grew on me, it's a fun dance number about pop culture and materialism. I understand with this project now that Jewel wanted to encorporate her meaningful lyrics with dance music, showing that it is possible. It's not a sell out either, since this music isn't popular like it was a few years ago. Not to say it's bad by any means. The best track for me is ""2 Find U"", a nice love song. ""Run 2 U"" is another favorite. ""Leave The Lights On"" has a nice groove and reminds me a bit of Nelly Furtado. ""Haunted"" is another great track here. ""2 Become 1"" is a great love song. The album reminds me a bit of Sheryl Crow's second album, picking up strands of pop music and familiar lyrics, and including odd pop-culture references and name-dropping along the songs. This is still the same Jewel, just with dance beats. And it is her most enjoyable album yet. Overall fans might be taken aback but with an open mind, people will be sure to enjoy this CD.","So this is Jewel .

A3STHS6DG1ZZFP,B00123KDRE,-1,1,5,"This album really has all you need from them. Candlebox is one of those bands that defiantly jumped on the Grunge band-wagon that conquered the early 90s in Alternative Music. The only problem is that they weren't as good as the bands they were most likely influenced from. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, and Soundgarden were just so much better and created a legacy in the trail they left behind. Candlebox just sort of had a moment where people enjoyed the sound of Grunge so much they were desperate for more and they heard ""Far Behind"" and instantly called it worthy. You could arguably say Candlebox is a one hit wonder, I disagree with that statement but its understandable why others might think that. What's included on this best of is really the best of what they put out. Everything here is really all you need to hear to truly see what they had to offer to music. Its a shame things didn't really work out for the band, but it probably wouldn't of mattered because its not like they put out anything that really defined a generation.","that defiantly jumped on the Grunge band - wagon The only problem is that they were not as good as the bands they were most likely influenced from .

I can play it on my CD player... where I can have it on

I had heard most of the songs on the list, but had somehow overlooked this one entirely.  Cracked has a sketchy record when it comes to recommendations, in my opinion, but given that I loved most of the other songs on this particular list (""Eye of the Tiger,"" ""Don't Stop Believing,"" ""Holding Out for a Hero,"" ""Love is a Battlefield,"" etc.), I decided I had to give this one a listen.

I'll just say... if you're an unabashed fan of cheesy '80s poodle-hair rock, you will love this song.  :D

There's nothing subtle whatsoever about this song.  From the triumphant and soaring synthesizer opening to the epic guitar and drum riffs, this song's instrumentation is the epitome of goofy '80s rock.  The lyrics, while simple, are also rather nonsensical, seeming to hint toward a group of astronauts leaving Earth but otherwise defying easy explanation.  And the lead singer's voice is nothing to write home about, though at least he actually tries to carry the tune and doesn't just yell into the microphone.

And yet somehow, this all WORKS.  It's a goofy song, yes, but it's the kind of goofy that leaves a huge smile on your face.  It's a song that's completely over-the-top but in the best possible way, and you can't help but want to bang your head and sing along when it comes on.  I haven't listened to anything else by Europe -- and from what I understand this is their only real hit -- but they sure hit a home run with this number.

This song has found plenty of new fans thanks to ""Arrested Development,"" but even if you've never seen that show, it's almost impossible not to like this song.  It's not the greatest hit of the '80s, but it sure is one of the most fun... and yes, one of the most terrifyingly epic.","I love the music of the ' 80s ... but somehow I was blissfully unaware of this song 's existence until I stumbled upon it in a list from Cracked -- "" The Most Terrifyingly Epic Songs of the ' 80s .

O.N.I.F.C. is a boring album with a repetitive sound and irrelevant content, Wiz Khalifa does nothing to heighten the enjoyment as his flow and delivery is lazy and uninteresting.  The production consists of a laid back and chill vibe with a slow bpm.  The sound is very cohesive and it transitions well but the tracks come off repetitive and not attention grabbing; only the Neptune's track catches the ear.  Wiz Khalifa delivers a decent but rather lazy performance, literally talking about that same ol' jazz: marijuana, money, lavish living.  There is a little bit of meaning but that is essentially muffled by the excessive irrelevance.  Boring and uninteresting.","ENJOYMENT : 4/8

They received several Grammy awards. Their most successful album was their fourth one, 'Toto IV', released in 1982. It went triple Platinum. It spawned several singles, 'Africa' being one of them.

Fast, slow, fast  the standard tempo variations of much of the baroque eras orchestral and solo instrumental music. As the music reflected the architecture, life did not reflect the music. Does slow represent one-third of a lifestyle? Ah, the enlightened among us say yes, even more than one-third. But the rest of us who are too busy to chase enlightenment, we need assistance from the world of classical music to slow it down a bit and grab a few minutes of peace and serenity from their compositions.

Sometimes in these blogs we discuss the music that has been unheard from the Bach Guild vaults, or tell stories of the recordings, but in this case, we have simply to say, the majority of what youll here is from the baroque recordings from the Bach Guild recordings. We've put all of the key artists from the label.

We've left some of the late classical and romantic adagios out so create a smoothness of transitions, and a consistency of mood. Our adagios are mostly upbeat and joyful, we've left some of the more melancholy and sad adagios out, but maybe they'll be put together in another selection soon.","Upon announcing the set , someone on the old social media declared it was a good time to slow down anywayso with our release of The Little Box of Adagios , we invite everyone to take a breath , relax Fast , slow , fast   the standard tempo variations of much of the baroque eras orchestral and solo instrumental music .

This is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" Collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son.  We've been trying to get him to tolerate headphones as part of the OT treatment plan for him.  In the clinic setting it's pretty much not happening at all, at home we occasionally can for short periods of time, but usually not, so it's a hill we've been dying on forever.  So this is a work around it kind of solution, where we were/are trying to do the best we can to support everybody on their/his therapy goals, while working with where our son is at, because as I was looking at the studies for ways to try and make this work for our family I saw that some of them indicated traditional unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits to the modulated music used as part of the AIT process in occupational therapy. Now the first track on this collection, it starts off very, very quiet.  Which I'm sure he doesn't mind because he has very sensitive hearing, but I have a hard time hearing it, and the first time it played I found myself wondering ""Is this working right?"" but then the volume picks up part way through the track.  We usually don't make it through this collection any further then the first track, because the Romeo and Juliet music has a more tense sound to it, and he struggles more with that in music.  He tends to like things that sound zippy, happy, and upbeat, and isn't a big fan of music that emotes tension, anger, those kinds of things.  So it's not one we get through much on usually, but it's a great value and price point for the number of tracks.","where I am rating it pretty much based on value . This is one of 7 "" Rise of the Masters "" Collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son . In the clinic setting it is pretty much not happening at all , at home we occasionally can for short periods of time , but usually not , so it is a hill we have been dying on forever . So this is a work around it kind of solution , where we were / are trying to do the best we can to support everybody on their / his therapy goals , while working with and make this work for our family I saw that some of them indicated traditional unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits to the modulated music used as part of the AIT process in occupational therapy . Now the first track on this collection , it starts off very , very quiet . Which I am sure he does not mind because he has very sensitive hearing , but I have a hard time hearing it , and the first time it played I found myself wondering "" Is this working right ?

While it is honestly a shame that they haven't scored well with anything new after the abrupt departure of Steve Perry, they do know that they have a legion of fans that never get tired of their classics. That is honestly the case with many of their songs including Don't Stop Believin'. The song is such a great classic of 80's Rock, that it simply never really gets too old. I love a lot of those classics that Journey made from that time, and it truly is a must to have as part of their music library, if you want it, any way you it for your MP3 Player.

A3H7HYC9HIQAAQ,B00M7I4OLO,1,1,4,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were all the rage for a few years when I was a kid in the 1980s, although to be fair I didn't know they were ninjas until quite some time later, thanks to the busybody interference of the self-appointed guardian of Britains national morals, Mary Whitehouse, who decided that showing children scenes of ninjas doing things with nunchaku would contribute to the decline of a generation. To me they will always be the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, and no-one can tell me otherwise, although looking back I now realize I never was entirely sure how Michelangelo defeated his foes with nothing more dangerous than a slice of pizza. This has been an astonishingly long-lived franchise  with the world having already been exposed to three separate animated TV series, a Japanese anime, a live-action TV series, we are now on our fifth movie based on the characters originally created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984, following the original three movies in 1990, 1991 and 1993, and the 2007 CGI flop TMNT. This latest installment is essentially an origin story reboot of the entire story, stars Megan Fox and Will Arnett, and is directed by Jonathan Liebesman.

The music of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films doesnt have the most distinguished history; Monty Python music maestro John Du Prez scored the first three films, but very little of his music saw the light of day on CD, and Klaus Badelt wrote a decent but little-remembered action score for TMNT in 2007. Enter Brian Tyler; having become Marvels go-to guy for music, with the scores for Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World already under his belt, and the score for Avengers: Age of Ultron yet to come, Tyler looks set to challenge Hans Zimmer for the title of King of All Super-Heroes, and his score for the Turtles continues the trend of him writing strong, powerful, thematic orchestral scores in the grandest symphonic traditions.

Brian Tyler has been writing wonderful music for Jonathan Liebesmans films for over a decade, ever since he scored the directors feature debut, Darkness Falls, in 2003, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles continues the trend. Anyone who has listened to a Brian Tyler action score in the last four or five years will know exactly what to expect: a large orchestra, a large choir, a strong main theme, lots of complicated action writing, and a sense of scale and volume that few composers can match these days. The main theme, first heard in the opening cue Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and reprised fully in the conclusive TMNT March, is a belter: brass-heavy, powerful, heroic, and often accompanied by a soaring choir. It has a few superficial similarities to his themes from both Thor: The Dark World and Iron Man 3, but on the whole this is immaterial. Tyler is pretty much the only guy writing memorable, recurring themes for super hero movies these days, and we need to be thankful for that fact alone.

The action music, by and large, is fast, dense, and lots of fun. Cues like the astonishing Splinter vs. Shredder, Turtles United, Shellacked, Shortcut, Cowabunga, and the enormously exciting Adrenaline are barnstormers. Most of them feature strong performances of the main theme, and all are embellished by flamboyant touches in the string phrasing, the brass countermelodies, and in the percussion patterns that underpin everything. Splinter vs. Shredder and Shortcut are especially noteworthy, with their chanted choral parts, back-and-forth brass writing, furiously slashing string runs, complicated rhythmic elements, and general sense of epic grandeur. For the most part, the electronic elements of the score are kept to a bare minimum, simply doubling the percussion or adding a secondary level of bubbling bass. Its unobtrusive, but maintains a level of coolness for contemporary audiences.

By way of comparison, some of the brass triplets remind me a little of James Horners most recent action music, especially scores such as Avatar and The Amazing Spider-Man, while some of horn/flute trills recall Michael Giacchinos Star Trek music. Similarly, the penultimate cue Buck Buck has a touch of the best parts of Hans Zimmers Man of Steel about it; to be clear, all of these things are good things.

To hint at the Oriental origins of the quartet, Tyler peppers his music with an occasional taste of the land of the rising sun, with trilling Japanese bamboo flutes and immense taiko drums underpinning several tracks. Cues such as the aforementioned Splinter vs. Shredder, Origins and Shredder play up this aspect of the score, and give it a different flavor than some of its contemporaries that is very appealing.

If Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a downside, its its total and utter lack of subtlety. Im not saying that a comic book film about crime fighting amphibians requires the restraint and sensitivity that a more grounded movie needs  things need to be larger-than-life  but Tyler scores almost every scene in the film with apocalyptic bombast, as though every moment is the most important moment of the story, and by the end of the 70-minute album I can anticipate some listeners will find the whole thing a little overwhelming. Theres very little sense of anticipation, build-up and catharsis; the score whangs you over the head from the first moment of the first cue, and continues whanging you over the head virtually the entire time until its all over.

As such, there only a few moments of downtime. Adolescent Genetically Altered Shinobi Terrapins has some soothing choral work, an intimate piano element, and a mystery-shrouded little cello figure reminiscent of Tia Dalmas theme from the third Pirates of the Caribbean film. Later, Origins features some lovely harp glissandi, Brotherhood features an emotional string-and-choir theme that is quite exquisite, and Rise of the Four revisits the emotional choral panache heard during the opening moments of the first cue, before segueing into yet another rousing performance of the main theme. Finally, at the very end of Buck Buck a soothing electronic guitar element comes to take center stage, providing a sentimental, but defiantly contemporary coda to all the chaos.

Having covered those caveats, I have to say that in terms of sheer entertainment value, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is one of the most enjoyable scores of 2014 for me so far. Unpretentious scores which kick ass while wearing their hearts on their sleeves are hard to come by these days; too many scores, especially in the super hero genre, have begun take themselves far too seriously, eschewing escapist entertainment in favor of tortured, dark tales of retribution and twisted morality. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the antidote to all that, but being unpretentious and entertaining doesnt mean sacrificing musical creativity or compositional dexterity, which Tyler once again proves he has in spades.","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were all the rage for a few years although to be fair I did not know they were ninjas until quite some time later , thanks to the busybody interference of the self - appointed guardian of Britains national morals , Mary Whitehouse , that showing children scenes of ninjas doing things with nunchaku would contribute to the decline of a generation . To me they will always be the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles , and no - one can tell me although looking back I now realize I never was entirely sure how Michelangelo defeated his foes with nothing more dangerous than a slice of pizza . This has been an astonishingly long - lived franchise   with the world having already been exposed to three separate animated TV series , a Japanese anime , a live - action TV series , we are now on our fifth movie based on the characters originally created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984 , following the original three movies in 1990 , 1991 and the 2007 CGI flop TMNT . The music of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films does not have the most distinguished history ; Monty Python music maestro John Du Prez scored the first three films , and Klaus Badelt wrote a decent Enter Brian Tyler ; having become Marvels go - to guy for music , with the scores for Iron Man 3 and Thor : The Dark World already under his belt , yet to come , Tyler looks set to challenge Hans Zimmer for the title of King of All Super - Heroes , and his score for the Turtles continues the trend of him writing strong , powerful , thematic orchestral scores in the grandest symphonic traditions . Brian Tyler has been writing wonderful music for Jonathan Liebesmans films for over a decade , ever since he scored the directors feature debut , Darkness Falls , in 2003 , or five years will know exactly what to expect : a large orchestra , a large choir , a strong main theme , lots of complicated action writing , and reprised fully in the conclusive TMNT March , is a belter : brass - heavy , powerful , heroic , It has a few superficial similarities to his themes from both Thor : The Dark World but on the whole this is immaterial . Tyler is pretty much the only guy writing memorable , recurring themes for super hero movies these days , and we need to be thankful for that fact alone . that fact alone . and large , is fast , dense , and lots of fun . Cues like the astonishing Splinter vs. Shredder , Turtles United , Shellacked , Shortcut , Cowabunga , and the enormously exciting Adrenaline are barnstormers . Most of them feature strong performances of the main theme , and Shortcut are especially noteworthy , with their chanted choral parts , back - and - forth brass writing , furiously slashing string runs , complicated rhythmic elements , and general sense of epic grandeur . and The Amazing Spider - Man , while some of horn / flute trills recall Michael Giacchinos Star Trek music . Similarly , the penultimate cue Buck Buck has a touch of the best parts of Hans Zimmers Man of Steel about it ; to be clear , all of these things are good things . and immense taiko drums underpinning several tracks . and Shredder play up this aspect of the score , that is very appealing . If Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a downside , its its total and utter lack of subtlety . that a comic book film about crime fighting amphibians requires the restraint but Tyler scores almost every scene in the film with apocalyptic bombast , as though every moment is the most important moment of the story , and by the end of the 70 - minute album I can anticipate some listeners will find the whole thing a little overwhelming . There Is very little sense of anticipation , build - up Adolescent Genetically Altered Shinobi Terrapins has some soothing choral work , an intimate piano element , and a mystery - shrouded little cello figure reminiscent of Tia Dalmas theme from the third Pirates of the Caribbean film .

While I enjoyed much of his work as lead guitarist with The Beatles I was really not too sure that he could make it as a solo artist.

In the years that followed I found that much to my surprise George's work as a solo artist was by far the most interesting to me of all of the Fab Four.

A2E5GLJPQAMOBS,B009578K5Q,1,1,4,"For much of my 17 years of Grateful Dead fandom I was, admittedly, what Deadheads refer to as a 60's & 70's snob. Out of my massive collection of live tapes and Dick's Picks, only a handful were from the Brent Mydland years of '79-'90 or later. It took me rediscovering--five or six years back--1990's 'Without A Net,' with it's excellent versions of ""Bird Song"" and ""Eyes of the World,"" for me to rethink my stance. Through Archive.org, I've now come to appreciate every era of the Dead, and I believe the Spring 1990 tour to be their most consistently stellar since '77. They've had other runs in that span that may have had higher  peaks but, with this tour, one could basically pick any show at random to listen to and it's virtually guaranteed to be a winner.

'Spring 1990: So Glad You Made It'--a compilation whittled down from the 18-disc box set released last month--is an excellent companion piece to the aforementioned 'Without A Net,' featuring highlights from six of the best shows in March. We finally get an official release of the legendary Albany ""Loser"" from March 24th, and the Brent Mydland-sung ""Blow Away"" from March 16th in Landover, MD. Brent, without a doubt, had the best pure singing voice of anyone in the Dead at this point, and its a shame he died a few scant months after these shows. Even though he was their longest tenured keyboardist, I would love to have heard more from him, considering the band were in the middle of a live mini-renaissance beginning the year prior, which was unfortunately cut short by his untimely death. He's one of the most talented backing keyboardists of all-time, imo, even if it did take me a while to get used to the (at times) ""carnival-ish"" sound of his keys.

Elsewhere we get 14-plus minute versions of ""Bird Song"" and ""Eyes"" that rival 'Without a Net's.' I know it's hard to top Branford Marsalis's sax-laden version of ""Eyes,"" but I almost prefer this one, as Jerry's precise noodling comes through more, along with the interweaving of the various instruments. Then again I could just be burnt out on the other due to a ridiculous amount of repeated listens. The ""Jack-a-Roe"" is one of the best electric versions I've heard, and Bob sounds positively possessed on one of the more exploratory latter-day ""Estimated Prophet""s. Also included is one of the most powerful, heartfelt ""Morning Dew""s of the era, which slowly builds and builds, Jerry pouring his soul into each and every verse until the song erupts into all-out bliss.

The only negative for me is that the sound-quality is a little underwhelming--with less clarity and less ""oomph"" in the bass compared with other releases--though it's still loads better than any soundboard tape you can get from this tour. It's just weird to me that I have many 40 year-old, 2-track live recordings of the Dead that sound crisper than these 22 year-old shows. I know the band recorded some of their 80's and 90's shows straight to cassette as opposed to reel to reel, which affected the sound-quality in some cases. I'm not sure if that's the case here, but it's still just a minor complaint, as it's definitely better than most live albums by other bands from this era.

'Spring 1990: So Glad You Made It' is absolutely essential for Deadheads, and for fans of just-plain great music in general. You get the best of both worlds here--from upbeat, head-bobbin' numbers to deeper, more tripped-out jams--and therefore it would serve as a great introduction to later-period Dead, if you are (like I once was) hesitant to explore this era. It still blows my mind that, with the wealth of live material released year after year by this band, that there are still these amazing gems that are just now getting released.

And I have a feeling that these past 20 years of archival releases may be just the tip of the iceberg. I may not be the religious sort, but...thank God for the Grateful ""goshdarn"" Dead.","For much of my 17 years of Grateful Dead fandom I was , admittedly , what Deadheads refer to as a 60 's & 70 's snob . and Dick 's Picks , only a handful were from the Brent Mydland years of ' 79-'90 or six years back--1990 's ' Without A Net , ' with it is excellent versions of "" Bird Song "" Through Archive.org , I have now come to appreciate every era of the Dead , and I believe the Spring 1990 tour to be their most consistently stellar since ' 77 . and it is virtually guaranteed to be a winner .

A2ZV4HHJE8G5S8,B0014HVZX4,1,1,5,"Directions To See A Ghost with it's menacing, staggering, stumbling, Jim Morrison over tones, drenched in hypnotic intoxicating drones of heavy acid trip visuals, primal drumming, and garage guitar, all blend to create a bleary eyed fantasy of mind meets soul meets eye, and washes oceans of sound through your ears.  As persuasive as The Black Angels are on record, they are even more so live, and not to be missed on any account.  The Black Angels are a psychological rhythmic reason for stepping into the moonlight, downing a handful of psychedelics, and watching the pageant unfold before your very eyes.  Even the gated album and disc jackets are heavily embossed to visually and texturally trip you out.

There's a dynamic chemistry found here, created from low end vibrations, Jimmy Page hooks, and Middle Eastern influences that don't so much build in momentum ... rather they steadily carry you forward with an intoxicating obsession.  As dark and lustrious as this album is, it feels very warm, nuturing, inviting, and impressive ... at times startling, fuzzed out, and breathtaking.  But you see, I'm trying to describe an acid trip, or a head full of mushrooms, and that's just about impossible ... you're either on board and know exactly what I'm talking about, or you're at the station, ticket in hand, waiting on sixty tons of locomotive to pull up, drop the steps, punch your ticket, and take you for the ride of a lifetime.

Interesting Note:  The Black Angels, like many others, have been heavily influenced by The Velvet Underground, copping their band name from The Velvet's track ""Black Angel's Death Song.""  And as if that weren't enough, they drew the connection even tighter by naming their publishing company Death Song, thus completing the song title in full.

The lyrics are profound, the chorus is powerful, the guitar work is nuanced.  I figured it was probably some new folk-rock group.  Would not have guessed in a million years that it was One Direction.  The same guys that sang ""That's What Makes You Beautiful?"", the song that had 8 words in it?  No.  Can't be.

But it is.  And I still love this song.  It's probably my favorite song of 2013.

It has such kaleidoscopic scope, container of vibrant themes and hovered by contagious flair that, once you listen you will hardly be able to do without about it.

Since the Latin beginning ""Broadband"" , passing through the marvelous and suggestive ballad ""Angle of repose"", the original song of African roots ""Timbuktu"" , the magnificent theme ""Night Jessamine"" with funk accents, to the most experimental and dynamically moving ""Scylla"" in which harmonizes expression and introspection, until the last track ""Never alone"" Brecker always exposed with his inimitable style and touch of class tracks like ""Brexterity"", the captivating ""Evening faces"" and the fabulous ""Modus operandi"" makes me think about an innermost musical journey .

This album has not waste. You must acquire as soon as you can. It's far from being just a fashionable album. It's precisely the contrary: a timeless item for connoisseurs.

A22RWESWT2K9HV,B005MVLI8A,1,1,4,"I love the instrumentation of this album, very bassy, very deep.  Take out ""Polly"", ""Territorial P..."", ""Get Away"", ""Breed"" and you have a more or less excellent set of songs.  ""Lithium"" is kinda stupid, IMO.  I don't get what his point is.  I read he wrote it regarding the time he spent living with Evangelical Christian guardians as a youth.  The song also has a melody that seems like a parody of children's sing-along shows a la Barney(sp?).  ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" is full of fire and life, ""In Bloom"" feels weak in comparison, but has good beefy bass driven production and one gets the impression that it has a purpose, although its anyone's guess as to what he's singing about (again, thanks to Wikipedia for providing that info free of charge!  Not like I needed to know anyway, but thanks!!).  ""Come As You Are"" is a somber piece, with an almost march-like beat, until the chorus gives way.  I used to associate ""I swear I don't have a gun"" with his 1994 alleged suicide (some swear his wife did it), but it occurred to me a few days ago, he probably meant to convey, ""Come as you are because I come in peace"".  Anyway...listening to the whole album after all these years is an exercise in tedium, but if you've never heard it before, you're probably missing out.","I love the instrumentation of this album , very bassy , very deep . or less excellent set of songs .

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"Enough with the negative reviews on this cd. It's too different for the hardcore fans, etc., etc. It's too much like Christina Aguilera or Britany Spears, which is inaccurrate. You know, there was a time when a female artist could jump genres of music and receive accolades instead of dismissals. Olivia Newton-John, Tina Turner, Cher, Madonna, Annie Lennox, Sinead O'Connor--all were able to shift gears musically, and to me that's a sign of talent, not selling out. Sure, Jewel is finely airbrushed on the cover, the titles are written like Prince tunes (U & Me= Love, Run 2 U, Yes U Can), and the songs are polished to fine pop bliss. I, for one, find this cd to be one of Jewel's finest. She forgoes all the pseudo-serious folk preaching and gets down to business with a cd filled with upbeat tracks instead of her serious ballads. However, she is still writing about serious topics such as social issues in ""Stand"" and ""America"" along with other familiar themes of love such as ""Run 2 U"", ""Fragile Heart"" and ""2 Become 1"". She also deals with letting go and trying new things such as the first single ""Intuition"", which probably flew over most Jewel fans' heads. She even deals with lust on ""Sweet Temptation"", ""U & Me= Love"" and ""Yes U Can"". In fact, there are a number of hits on this disc: ""Stand"", ""Run 2 U"", ""Intuition"", ""Leave The Lights On"", ""2 Find U"", ""Fragile Heart"", ""Sweet Temptation"", ""Yes U Can"", ""America"" & ""Becoming"". The only True miss is the overlong ""Haunted"", which seemed out of place. This new direction is great--a breath of fresh air for Jewel. She sounds like she's having fun and the music represents that spirit. Too many reviewers are taking this cd too seriously. This could be Jewel's ""Thriller"" or ""Hysteria"" or ""No Jacket Required"". If you're looking for intelligent pop (which Aguilera and Spears are not), then pick this up (also if you like the 80's).","Enough with the negative reviews on this cd .

This CD has been one of her favorite discs for her car stereo rotation so I've been listening to it on a regular basis over the past 3 years, probably hearing the entire thing about once every other month.

AKUMRHVDLD47I,B00AFIZJM6,1,1,5,"Edit noticed sampler has a price 6/15
Track 1. Home by Lights & Motion. Mellow instrumental number, synthesizers and smooth noises. Nice.

Why Aren't I Home? by Athletics. Starts quiet and slow. Perky strings & keyboards lead to superior soaring vocal that strains to convey strength & feeling as the band joins in the effort to satisfy & surprise. This is a great song because of the vocal. Love it.

Steps And Numbers by The Appleseed Cast. Vocal a little buried on nothing fancy indie/emo song that does not offend. Drums & hollow singing lead the song. Okay sound on this 6 minute song.

Colors In Stereo by Moonlit Sailor. Strong instrumental song with depth & many moving parts to keep you listening. Lie back and enjoy as the sounds wash over you, if you like you'll wanna hear more (they have more). Very nice.

Inglend Part3 by Last Lungs. Another strong instrumental with raw edges and neat sound. Like it.

Sleep by The Cast Before the Break. Neat Ambient song, great lead singer who roams around his vocal range in front of rowdy band that moves from raw indie to cool ambient. I am really enjoying this sampler. Great complex song that has a few unnecessary lulls (for me) still rocks.

Drifters by The Dandelion War. ""Lavish Atmospherics"" is how their own Record Label(Deep Elm) describes The Dandelion War's new album(includes this song). Describes this 7 minute track well, not for me still very nice song.

Track 7. The Morning Bus by Dorena. More Ambient/Atmospheric music. I was going to copy & paste great line from their Record company's web site that describes their music perfectly. Won't let me. You know if you like this genre.

Nothing Remains Forever Yet The Future Still Holds Hope by Goonies Never Say Die. I swear this song has the same riff as the previous song although these guys rock the theme, building and layering on more sound, band and imagination. Instrumental song with much more to enjoy. Love it.

Fog Is Drowning Us by I Am Sonic Rain. Best band name in a while. Instrumental number that stays awake despite mellow chunks, nothing new, okay.

Red Lightning Child/Great Emptiness by Coma Recovery. Another instrumental track, This sampler has forced me to listen more closely to instrumental songs admit many rock. This is strong busy track, no vocals but pounding collection of band parts that keeps your attention. Never breaks out into hard rock (to me) but easily rides the edge for the whole wave. Very nice, like it.

Final track, Day After Day by Our Lost Infantry. Identifiable lead vocalist who melds with great band who rock. I am not a fan of pausing the action during anything, song rules so they get a pass. Wall of sound smacking against your face (in a good way), love it.

Amazon genre shows as Alternative Rock, Rock which this free sampler from Deep Elm Records is, however the sampler contains so much more than 2 genres. Not everyone's cup-o-tea, give it a chance, somehow I gave 2 songs 5 stars(Day after Day & Why Aren't I Home?) and 5 songs 4 stars in iTunes. Maybe I was in the mood for something new, maybe this is a brilliant collection of new music & I am smart enough to get it.

The year end charts rate it highly, and was a worldwide hit. At about the same time, Sia was also top 10 with Flo Rida's ""Wild One"". She has a huge voice, very unique and powerful. If you listen to some of her Zero 7 stuff, you would say WOW she let loose!

Personally, I have been listening to Trance/Electronic/Club/House etc since the nineties and last year finally it hit the top 10 here regularly. David Guetta is one reason, with his many collaborations. This song just hit the mark, it built up slowly, people started to listen, hit top 10 and stayed in the top 100 for a VERY long time.

The song is one of my all time favorites, just plain inspirational. The beat is tremendous, the words mean something, the vocals are plain spectacular. A True anthem.

AGGP8FKBFDHL1,B0070OEGHW,1,1,4,"Sleeze Beez were another in the long list of decent bands from the late 80's/early 90's that never achieved the success they deserved. While they had everything needed to succeed, for whatever reason, they just never got there.

""Insanity Beach"" is Sleeze Beez's third and final album. With the release of ""Insanity Beach"", Sleeze Beez took a more harder rocking approach than with their previous releases. Gone is the Def Leppard sound alikes, and in it's place is a more modern hard rock sound. Now don't get me wrong, this album still has that Sleeze Beez sound, it just doesn't have that over-the-top catchiness that ""Screwed, Blued & Tattoed"" and ""Powertool"" had. The album does contain some filler, but the good far outweighed the bad. My favorite tracks from the album are ""Tell It To The Judge"", ""The Long Goodbye"", ""Save Myself"", ""Scream"" and ""Gun Culture"".

The worst thing about this album is, it's almost non-existent for some reason. I know it was released only in Japan, but come on, where in the world is Rock Candy or Wounded Bird??? Thankfully Amazon.com has it for download for a reasonable price, otherwise most people would never get to hear this great record.","Sleeze Beez were another in the long list of decent bands from the late 80's / early 90 's that never achieved the success they deserved .

The band's latest single No Surprise, doesn't feel like it honestly is as invigorant as was the case with hard core fans when they broke out a few years ago. I felt that the song wasn't over the top at all. I just thought the song honestly didn't measure up to the feeling they had on songs like What About Now? or Home had. Hopefully, the next single from Daughtry can strike the louder Rock notes that could've been expected.

A1X73QJ7D1W57Q,B008GOL5G0,1,1,5,"CSN has not exactly flooded the market with new releases - the latest release of the 3 together being the CSNY release of ""Deja Vu Live"" which was extremely Neilocentric, to say the least. So for all fans this is a very welcome occasion to hear an official, brilliantly recorded concert.

And thankfuly they deliver a profound evening, mixing the old classics with newer songs, including Graham Nash's controversial and poignant tribute to Bradley Manning ""Almost Gone"". And diving deep into their impressive back catalogue, specially Stephen Stills who come up with the rarely performed ""As I Come Of Age"" and ""So Begins The Task"" (both played at the CSNY 1970 tour). Especially the first is truly magic, providing one of the moments of transcendent (vocal) beauty that is unique for this trio.

Much malign has been said about Stills's vocal, but actually his singing is better here than it has been in many years really enabling him to hit the higher notes. And his legendary guitarplaying as firery and riveting as ever. Graham Nash - probably one of the all time most underrated songwriters - and David Crosby still delivers their trademark harmony vocals.

As some of the other reviews here sadly demonstrates this band has for whatever reasons always attracted a certain animosity and some decisevely unfair criticism (I have good ears and I don't hear any False or rough vocals on this recording at all).

Sure the day when they were the vanguard is long gone, but what they deliver 2012 is very far from nostalgia and cash-in. So their broad and dedicated fan base should delight in this. And for new fans/listeners this might be the perfect introduction to one of the most adventurous and prolific bands ever.","So for all fans this is a very welcome occasion to hear an official , brilliantly recorded concert .

A3FN03XD1O3KNY,B001NBIP52,-1,-1,1,"It isn't!

How funny is this, I downloaded this a few days before it was offered in the 25 Days Of Free thinking it seemed very odd for Lady GaGa to be doing ""O Christmas Tree"" but I also downloaded a bunch of other stuff at the same time that I was in a bigger hurry to listen to.  Then I got so wrapped up in protesting the listing of ""Slower Than Christmas"" that I didn't even take the time to look at the reviews this song was getting until today's offering of Badd Santa ""Christmas Girl"".  I hadn't even listened to it until today.  Surprise surprise, it isn't ""O Christmas Tree"" after all, but a song that makes sexual metaphors out of Christmas trees (and female metaphors at that, figure that one out).

Setting the gross inappropriateness of this song aside for a moment, this is a weak song musically.  If I'm not mistaken, there are two lines in the entire song, maybe three.  It makes a strange shift in the middle to Space Cowboy rapping the same line, then shifts back to GaGa, and then finishes with one of my big pet peeves, a self reference (and a double one at that)!  The backing music is a choppy, repetitive bed of electronic harmony which has nothing exciting to offer.  The only thing this song brings to the table is overt sexuality.  Coming from a former burlesque dancer, this seems no surprise.  That Amazon wants to advertise it as part of the 25 Days Of Free would be surprising if it weren't a part of a disturbing trend this year.

Amazon is trying very hard to push the ""edgy"" envelope and it is leaving a lot of us scratching our heads.  I think it would be more understandable if the edgy songs in question were particularly good, but they aren't.  This song brought to mind a song they sometimes play on Bob and Tom about Santa going to town, only that song is FUNNY, this isn't.

This song is blatantly irresponsible in that it is targeted at pop music buyers.  The age bracket for pop music buyers is 12(ish) to 25.  The upper range of that bracket I have no issue with, but this includes middle school kids.  Singing this kind of innuendo to middle schoolers is just plain wrong.  With the setup of getting this song off a Christmas recommendation list and an innocuous title that can easily be mistaken for an age old Christmas carol, I'm sure this will lead to many kids getting their hands on this right under their parents' unsuspecting noses.

While their first album Kill 'Em All relied more on speed metal, Ride The Lightning showed the band expanding their musical horizons and their songwriting abilities, which would lead to their breakthrough in America.
Every track here is very strong with many of them becoming metal classics. The band wrote some of their best lyrics here as many of the tracks deal with personal issues such as drugs, death, and the struggle within. There is much diversity to be found here whether it's the excellent speed metal of ""Fight Fire With Fire"" and ""Trapped Under Ice"" or the longer epics ""The Call Of Ktulu"", the title track, and the awesome ""Creeping Death."" The menacing ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" and ""Escape"" are also very strong tracks. Then there's ""Fade To Black"", the best track the band has ever recorded, and is to heavy metal what ""Stairway To Heaven"" is to classic rock. This is simply an incredible song, between its several different movements and its lyrics which tell of a man contemplating suicide. The guitar solo from Kirk Hammett during the song's outro is one of the best ever of the genre. Simply one of the best albums ever recorded in heavy metal.

A2R35DE00SQDJQ,B005BIBRVC,1,1,5,"Being a new age music journalist for over 30 years as well as a music producer myself who has worked on a number of guided meditation recordings, I can say that, in my experience, Meditations2Go are some of the best I've heard. The series is the work of Rob Brookler, who has been a meditation teacher in the Los Angeles area for 28 years Having worked with many groups and individuals in that time, he draws from real life experience and has created a practical approach to not only focusing the mind, but on gaining insight into many of the issues that are prevalent in our day to day lives. In addition to the audio meditations, his website also offers a wealth of well-written articles that offer guidance for a variety of personal challenges and life learning. While these are presented as a supplement to the meditations and embody many of the principles found within, they can be quite helpful in their own right, and the fact that they are available to read free of charge speaks to the positive intention and goodwill of Rob and his site

One of the things that impressed me the most about Meditations2Go is how well produced and professional they are. A standout feature for me is Rob's voice.

The series is the work of Rob Brookler , who has been a meditation teacher in the Los Angeles area for 28 years Having worked with many groups and has created a practical approach to not only focusing the mind , but on gaining insight into many of the issues In addition to the audio meditations , his website also offers a wealth of well - written articles that offer guidance for a variety of personal challenges and embody many of the principles found within , they can be quite helpful in their own right , that they are available to read free of charge speaks to the positive intention and goodwill of Rob that impressed me the most about Meditations2Go is how well produced A standout feature for me is Rob 's voice . and timbre , as well as his pacing and cadence are about as perfect as you could want for something of this nature .

With the formation of LXW (League of Xtraordinary Worshippers) he shows the world why young people are not to be written off when it comes to worship and setting an example.

In the single GREAT GOD they begin the song by proclaiming ""Let the world know you serve a great God."" In other words this is something to be celebrated, not hit.

What makes God so great and worthy to be praised? You have only to look at the way He cares for us as His creation and children. ""All through the day and through the night,"" LXW sings, ""there are angels watching over my life. i'm not afraid of the terrors that might come through the night."" Individuals of faith have no reason to fear what the enemy might bring our way. We know that God is great enough to cover us regardless of the attack.

""Ain't nobody like him,"" LXW reminds us. No matter where you look, there is no one that can do for us what our Heavenly Father is able to accomplish. For this reason along LXW's single GREAT GOD gives us yet another reader to praise God for being all that He is and is doing in our lives.","When it comes to worship it is well known and get in the mood to praise .

A1UJ664NV4S07T,B00940XDF6,1,1,5,"""Tornado"" is Little Big Town's fifth album, but is the album where the country group has achieved the most success. The album's first single ""Pontoon"" reached #1 on the country charts.  The second single, ""Tornado"", had entered the top 10.  ""Pontoon"" is a catchy little song about having fun of a boat, complete with a double-entendre (""Mmmm, motorboatin'!).

There isn't a weak track on the entire album.  The lyrics throughout the album are strong.  That is especially True for ""Tornado"" (the title track).  Like a few other tracks, it is about forlorn love.  Although a country group, there's a lot more to the group than country. They're not a typical `new country act.  There are a lot of classic rock, soul, and gospel elements in their music.  For instance, ""Leavin' In Your Eyes"" sounds like something Fleetwood Mac could have done in the late 70s.  ""Front Porch Thing"" has some gospel harmonies at the beginning. The members of Little Big Town often harmonize their voice together, something uncommon in new country music. Every member of the band is a strong vocalist, and they harmonize very well.  On ""Can't Go Back"", the entire track is harmonizing.

""Sober"" is an excellent country pop ballad that highlights the lead vocalist's talents. I could see Taylor Swift performing it. ""Self Made"" features heavier guitars than other tracks.  I could see Tim McGraw performing it.

I would recommend this album not only to country fans, but also fans of soulful rock.

AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000QF3TZC,1,1,5,"Never understood the distain that John Cale has for Honi Soit a blistering set of rock tunes played by a killer band. Cale, perhaps, felt that this didn't quite live up to what he wanted it to be but, to my ears and sensibility, it remains a classic slice of Cale with blistering lyrics and his voice is, at turns, husky and deep or shrill depending on what emotion he's trying to convey. Mind you, shrill for Cale can be a good thing--it matches the music here in many cases.

This new reissue (and remastered) edition of Honi Soit has a much stronger bass than the original CD--it isn't bloated at least to my ears but adds some bite and attack to the music. There may be a small amount of digital compression used based on some of the comparisons I've seen but, in a rare case of more is more, it adds to the music for me with this album. The original German pressing has a lighter touch to be sure. The comparison for me is a cool side walk perfectly uniform and fairly smooth while this reminds me more of a recently paved road on a hot day--you can feel the gravel under your feed but it isn't unpleasant.

This reissue (an import from Holland) doesn't have any extensive liner notes discussing the making of the album just features credits (no re-mastering credit though) for the musicians with photos on a two page spread and noting who played what instrument. I realize there are albums that Cale probably isn't completely happy with but they are a part of his past and should remain in print since they were put out there in the first place. Pretending they don't exist doesn't mean they don't and even ""Caribbean Sunset"" has its moments and should be available on CD and legit downloads.

This remains a worthy reissue and essential album for Cale fans. Now let's get the other albums that are out of print out there again. Even lesser gems and allow fans to appreciate Cale as imperfect art can sometimes be more interesting than a perfect masterpiece.

Cale has always been a challenging and innovative musician. I'd love to see him work with Brian Eno once again as they struck gold in the past with their collaboration on ""Wrong Way Up"".","that John Cale has for Honi Soit a blistering set of rock tunes played by a killer band . and sensibility , it remains a classic slice of Cale with blistering lyrics or shrill depending on what emotion he is trying to convey . Mind you , shrill for Cale can be a good thing -- it matches the music here in many cases . and remastered ) edition of Honi Soit has a much stronger bass than the original CD -- it is not bloated at least to my ears and attack to the music . The original German pressing has a lighter touch to be sure . The comparison for me is a cool side walk perfectly uniform and fairly smooth while this reminds me more of a recently paved road on a hot day -- you can feel the gravel under your feed but it is not unpleasant .

A2R9CA3YT1WUNV,B002M9LEDO,1,1,5,"In the same year that Grunge was well and truly selling billions of CDs worldwide, US Heavy Metal legends Manowar released their seventh full-length studio album  1992s The Triumph Of Steel.

It must have been no easy task following up their immensely popular and loyally beloved 1988 release Kings Of Metal, nor must it have been easy having to train up a new drummer and guitarist after losing Scott Columbus and Ross The Boss Friedman. In fact, nor can it have been fun trying to promote an album of blistering, powerful, OTT Heavy Metal after Man In The Box and Smells Like Teen Spirit changed what mustve felt like every journalist on earths priorities in the pre-internet culture of the day.

Despite all that was going against them, Manowar released what must surely be one of their greatest ever albums (certainly its my personal favourite at any rate). Call it ambition, or call it arrogance, but the band even opened up the record with a twenty-minute long song. A song with a bass solo, a drum solo so indulgent that it has a separate solo for the cymbals and for the drums, two minutes of somber guitar violining all telling the story of Achillies and Hector from Greek Mythology. The world wanted Touch Me Im Sick Manowar gave em Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts.

Despite how easy it is to skip a twenty-minute album opener with three solos in it, the song isn't poor. In fact, some sections of it are absolute genius, such as the furious Thrashy Death Hectors Reward part, which feels like the musical equivalent of being battered upside the head.

After that, the first normal-length track comes in. Its my favourite track on the album, or by the band. Metal Warriors is the most perfectly-pitched, sing-along tribute to Heavy Metal thats ever been written. Ludicrous to the point of featuring the lyric If you're not into Metal you are not my friend and yet musically out of this world. Its some kind of supercharged version of Kiss I Love It Loud filled with Painkiller screams, mountain-top chants and the screech of guitars that feel only-barely in control.

Theres more blistering speed, in the sword-and-scorcery realm of Ride The Dragon with its constant double-kicks and incredibly catchy chorus.

The band then take a different tack, choosing to sing about Native Americans in a surprisingly tasteful way, in an interesting mid-paced affair that sonically evokes cowboy movies subtly, but doesnt loose that Manowar sound. Maybe they were jealous of Anthrax? Who cares why they did it, but it works, really well!

Then they follow it up with another mid-paced track called Burning which youd imagine might be a momentum killer, but is actually one of the more interesting compositions in the bands catalogue. Its a bit different than their usual any of their usual directions epics, ballads, rousing anthems or blistering speed. Its a nice change of pace. Sort of experimental, with a lot of emphasis on dynamics and Eric Adams trying out as many vocal techniques as he can imagine.

Power Of Thy Sword comes next, and its what I would consider the quintessential Manowar song. If you wonder if the band are for you, this is one of the tracks you should use to decide. Its got everything thats great about the band in spades. Its so powerful, OTT and fun. Its beyond catchy, the solo is awesome, theres slow bits, fast bits and theres a touch of the orchestral epic-ness that the band aspire to. With this one song, you get a good musical, technical and lyrical picture of Manowar oh, and by the way its a great song too!

Even if the last one felt good enough to be an album closer, it doesnt stop there. Theres more Metal in the form of The Demons Whip. A robust, interesting track which is half crushing Sabbath-inspired Doom and half double-kick Thrash attack, almost-ending the album with a jarring reverse-whiplash effect as the too-slow doom accelerates out of control to the tune off way-too-loud whip samples.

It all closes with the grand, cinematic, vocally-impressive Master Of The Wind which kind of evokes Greg Lake-era King Crimson with its chiming bells, big reverb, dynamic production and haunting singing. Its probably the best ballad/orchestral-track that Manowar ever did. Not something to be skipped, but a genuine album highlight in itself.

Overall; Triumph Of Steel is a really diverse and almost strange album. Despite its seeming lack of focus, it really feels like Manowar just doing everything they could think of to absolute perfection. Anthem  nailed. Ballad  absolutely nailed. Fast bits  nailed. Slow bits  nailed. Exploring new ideas  nailed. Keeping True to what makes Manowar, Manowar  nailed. It might not have gotten the attention it deserved at the time, but for my money this album is a straight up-and-down masterpiece that shows what superb musicians, performers and songwriters Manowar are from every possible angle. Highly Recommended!","that Grunge was well and truly selling billions of CDs worldwide , US Heavy Metal legends Manowar released their seventh full - length studio album   1992s The Triumph Of Steel .

A2AIMXT9PLAM12,B00138JCXO,1,1,5,"The program notes are gushing when they call Bruno Walter the most eminent interpreter of Brahms in the twentieth century, but here is a conductor, still capable of making this powerful Brahms First in 1959, who was twenty when the composer died. He learned his Brahms fro no less than Hans von Bulow and would have met the composer n person except that Brahms had entered his last year and was too ill to travel (Walter's mentor Gustav Mahler made the journey to Sichl, where the aged Brahms spent his summers, and found the old man melancholy and misanthropic - yet from a modern perspective, Brahms was hardly elderly at 64).

There's no need for me to heap my praise on so many others'.  I only want to recount my surprise, after an absence of ten years or so,  on returning to Walter's stereo Brahms First and finding it  so dynamic and alert. When it first came out, his Columbia Sym. cycle was considered less than the mono one he made in the early Fifties with the NY Phil. Waning energies were attributed to Walter's troubles with heart disease, but that first cycle comes in raw sound, even when remastered, and it has some rough edges, too. There's a driven quality that might be the influence of Toscanini; there was enormous pressure in America for every conductor to ape Toscanini or fall under his shadow.

The remake is more Viennese, always moving forward but with a core of relaxed enjoyment in music-making. In the second movement we realize that not being close to Toscanini doesn't mean you've drawn near to Furtwangler. Walter's style isn't philosophical or searching. He's just a master of the traditional Romantic style that nurtured him in the nineteenth century.  without being personal, he's authentic. The orchestra can be criticized for imbalances due to an under-powered string body, but in Brahms's day the strings were often even less.  the scoring sounds sweeter and mellower for being able to hear horn and oboe almost all the time rather than Karajan's wall-of-sound violins. Walter is also more modest and lyrical than either Furtwangler or Karajan. In short, a reading that can carry you through a lifetime. It has Walter's famous singing quality and strength of purpose, too.

After recording the symphony in Nov. 1959, Walter returned the following January for the Haydn Variations and Academic Festival Over. (The latter at least used to be almost universally known to young listeners - but now?) Both are done with the same blend of mellowness and authority. For once, the overture actually feels festive with the extra snap Walter gives it.","when they call Bruno Walter the most eminent interpreter of Brahms in the twentieth century , but here is a conductor , still capable of making this powerful Brahms First in 1959 , when the composer died .

His latest single Lay Me Down, the third single from In The Lonely Hour absolutely works very well. It is a deep song that shows sincerely from the heart.

Now, it's a bit repackaged and looks nicer. It arrived today.  Excellent arrival speed and I'll buy from this seller again.  Well packaged, too, though the CDs were rattling around a bit.

These are the good rocking' blues that anyone can learn to enjoy.  Just put them on and your friends will be tapping their toes and nodding their heads, if not outright dancing.  You don't think of the blues as dance music, but most of the tunes on her are danceable.

Dick, they have a great beat and you can dance to them. Right?  American Bandstand anyone?  Enjoy!","Koko Taylor is a mad woman and looks nicer .

A4PTUEVFE13K6,B011DBV2NI,1,1,5,"Don Henley's first solo album in 15 years is being called his ""country debut"". My first thought was this was yet another classic rock artist trying to sell albums, so he's releasing a country album, the only genre that still sells in decent numbers. Turns out, this is not the case. Yes, this has some definite country elements to it, but it sounds, to me, like early Eagles. Perhaps it's the duet partners he's got, Miranda Lambert, Merle Haggard, Martina McBride and Dolly Parton. Or maybe it's the background vocalists, Vince Gill, Jimmy Johnson, Trisha Yearwood, and Alison Krause? Either way, this is just a great album.
 ""Waiting Tables"" could very easily be on an Eagles album today. As could ""Take A Picture of This"". The duet with Martina McBride, ""That Old Flame"" is a definite standout as is the Dolly duet ""When I Stop Dreaming"". There simply isn't a bad song on here.
 This isn't a case of classic rock artist switching to country to sell some records, this is a classic rock artist reaching the pointing in their career when they can do whatever they want.
 As a foot note, if you get the deluxe edition from Target you get two more songs, including yet another duet. This time with Stevie Nicks. 34 years after ""Leather And Lace"" they reunite with ""It Don't Matter To The Sun"".","yet another classic rock artist trying to sell albums , so he is releasing a country album , the only genre that still sells in decent numbers .

A9DG42O0DBLFJ,B01C9VPMZU,1,1,5,"Wow! That was my first impression after taking a listen to this album that was released in April 2016. This one is a bit older but is just catching on after Sturgill was nominated for two Grammy Awards (including Album of the Year). He won one Grammy for Best Country Album. I discovered the album just this week and this album is HOT! HOT! HOT! and in my mind should have won Album of the Year but of course Adele ""25"" won, which itself is an excellent album - but ""A Sailor's Guide To Earth"" is far more diverse, versatile and overall a much stronger album than ""25.""

Sturgill Simpson shows bits of David Gray, Alex Clare, Van Morrison and Ronnie Milsap. He is an old soul at the young age of 38. He writes songs with the wisdom of a sailor who has sailed the seas of life for twice the amount of decades of his actual age.

""A Sailor's Guide To Earth"" is categorized as a country music album and has climbed to #1 on both the country music and rock music charts as well as #1 on the folk music charts. It has also reached #3 on billboard's Top 200 albums chart. This week the album re-entered the Billboard chart at #44 with a bullet.

Though categorized as a country music album it is far more versatile than simply a country album. The depth in musicianship and lyrics puts the album in a category all it's own. This is quite simply one of the most intriguing albums of the past 20 years.

This album is full of introspection, joy and great guitar and synthesizer sounds... and Sturgill wrote all the songs to boot (except the cover of Nirvana's ""In Bloom"").

The album opens with the sounds of ship's bell chiming (a sound you hear on other songs throughout the album) and the beautiful tinkling of keyboards. ""Welcome To Earth"" sounds like a refreshing ocean morning relaxing in the mist of the ocean air. Three minutes in the song turns into a surprising upbeat Motown flavored experience with horns and R&B rhythms. As a matter of fact The Dap-Kings (famous for playing behind Sharon Jones) are the credited horn section on this song and several others on the album.

The otherworldly ""Breakers Roar"" is soothingly beautiful accented with country tinged steel guitars bringing out an ethereal sound that gives the song a floating feel. This song screams David Gray but so much more in it's intensity and beauty.

""Keep It Between The Lines"" is a traditional country song that breaks out with a high-stepping brass section very reminiscent of 1979 era Ronnie Milsap. This immediately made me think of Milksop's '79 hit ""Get It Up."" The song features some hot licking slide guitar and awesome electric guitar. The rhythm section fires up the funk keeping it all in a traditional country music style.

""In Bloom"" is the only song not written by Sturgill Simpson. ""In Bloom"" was written by Kurt Cobain and was featured on the 1992 Nirvana album ""Nevermind."" Sturgill took the song and made it all his own with an intense delicate power working into a storm of emotion and a wall of sound production.

Brace For Impact (Live A Little)"" is my favorite song from the album for many reasons. I love the David Gilmour style guitar chords and the music video is eerie and amazing. Simpson sings this anthemic song with conviction and intensity like no other singer of this decade. ""Brace For Impact"" is not what you would expect to hear on a country music album. With it's pulsating electric bass opening it is a song that sounds like it could have been written for a Pink Floyd album all the while maintaining it's country music influence. ""Brace For Impact"" is a song about death and how different people react to it's inevitability. Sturgill's dark guitars and electronic synthesizer drive this song and turn it into an event in music that should not be missed.

""All Around You"" is a great 1950s blues style country song while ""Oh Sarah"" is that country song filled with hurt, pain and joy.

The album closes with one of it's strongest songs. ""Call To Arms"" starts of with the distant sound of seagulls, ship bells and bag pipes. The bag pipes add this unusual sort of ocean sound to the song - it works quite well. Quickly the song turns funky with R&B honky tonk horns that makes the song feel like something you might have heard in the explosive 1980 film ""The Blues Brothers."" Let me tell you the guitar work in this song is absolutely killer. I am a huge fan of the guitar and Sturgill ranks right up there with the best of the best. The bluesy piano parts rock this song out which at points reminds me just a little bit of Elvis Presley.

""A Sailor's Guide To Earth"" is one of those albums that has surprises around each corner. The musical texture is as diverse as it gets and best of all Sturgill Simpson is a really great singer. I highly recommend this album to anyone that is an avid fan of diversity in music.","Wow !

A2WLRNFTHI67WX,B00DGN140I,1,1,4,"The 80's was the decade of great Christian music.  Stryper led the way and several other bands followed.  Barren Cross, Bloodgood, Holy Soldier, and Guardian set a new direction and gave musical hope for a multitude of young people who grew tired of what passed for ""music"" in that generation.  One band that rose up during those formative years was Sacred Warrior.  What made this band special was their no-nonsense lyrics that confronted listeners with the biblical gospel.  They were never afraid of confronting sin and speaking plainly about the problem of evil.  SW eventually broke up and went their separate ways.

Almost thirty years later, Sacred Warrior has returned with a new lead singer and a fresh, updated sound.  Their new album, Waiting in Darkness has all of the features described above.  The only difference is this: The music is faster and the rock is heavier.  In fact, this is their heaviest album to date.  It should come as no surprise that this brain-rattling music is accompanied by the same non-compromising approach to the gospel.  Each song on the album is a testimony to the gospel of grace.

Track by Track:

The album begins by addressing the problem of evil and the reality of redemption:

Desperately wicked we are born
Corrupted seeds
This stronghold grips humanity
The curse of sin

Flesh and spirit raging on the war within
Life or death cursed or blessed the choice is given
In the perfect sacrifice a hope remains
Redemption by shedding of blood love overcame

The title track, Waiting in Darkness is a heavy metal exposition of spiritual warfare:

Through your anger they fuel the fire
 Feeding off of your flesh's sinful desires
Lies and confusion your faith put to the test
Focusing in on all of your weaknesses
We must be vigilant to thwart their evil plight
Be strong in the lord and in the power of his might
Be prepared for war

In Dust and Ashes is a Job-like lament written in the first person that is sure to grip the attention of anyone who is enduring a dark night of the soul:

Oh lord hear my cry
I'm a man with many troubles
In the regions dark and deep
This world lies heavy on me

Your steadfast love remains
Even though I feel abandoned
Invade my soul
Break the chains of doubt and sorrow

Skin for skin all that I am
Will bless your name in you remain

In dust and ashes I repent
Resolved to make you my content
In dust and ashes I confess
My love for you within this test

Fear Me is a bold declaration of the sovereignty of God.

I speak and the waves obey I am governed by none,
sovereign over all  Wisdom begins and ends with me
All authority is mine and I'll put an end to evil's reign
For vengeance is mine says the lord

Fear me like you'd fear a raging fire
You'd never run into the flames
Respect keeps you from the pain
Or the raging of the ocean
You'd never jump into the waves  and sink to your grave
Fear me

To deny that I exist
Suppress the truth for a lie professing to be wise
The wrath I hold will be revealed
This world I will destroy
Judging all who reject my name

Fans of A.W. Pink will immediately wonder if the guys in Sacred Warrior have been meditating on the classic, The Sovereignty of God!

Long Live the King continues to confront the listener with the sovereignty of God over all things.

He is the lightning he is on high
Always and eternal and his love will never die
He is forever the answer to the rhyme
Of what will be for you and me before the start of time

I hear the thunder I hear the call
The armies of his angels from the royal temple hall
One day is a thousand years, still he's drawing nigh
Lift up your voice unto the sky shout the battle cry

Long live the king, Long live the king

Jealous Love is a ballad that glories in the Cross of Christ.

Day of the Lord is the token eschatological metal anthem and is rerecorded from their first studio album, Rebellion.  This one is a real blast from the past!  This is the kind of music that put Sacred Warrior on the map.

Fans of Sacred Warrior will only be encouraged by their latest record.  The music is tight, sounds current, best of all - exalts the Lord Jesus Christ!","The 80 's was the decade of great Christian music .

A1906RZITWT2K2,B001BZF788,1,1,5,"There was a time, not too long ago, when the Rhino label was ridiculed because it wasted a lot of time and effort releasing oddities that nobody needed--triple-disc box sets from one-hit wonders and the like--but, for my money, Rhino has become one of the most important labels in the industry.
That's because they have turned their attention to saving some forgotten classics from the dustbin. And don't kid yourself for a second, though it may never have been heard on LP-format FM radio when it was released in a more abbreviated format in 1973 (though it is one of Franklin's best selling LPs), AMAZING GRACE is one of the absolute classics of it's time, a chunky R&B treatment of Gospel by thE Queen of Soul.
Aretha Franklin ranks with Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald as one of the all-time great American singers, and this CD showcases her amazing pipes in a perfect setting: piano, organ, a bit of drums and guitar, but mostly the power of Cleveland and the Southern California Community Choir carrying things along. The mix gives Franklin room to breathe and move. The result is one of the earthiest albums you'll ever hear.
""How I Got Over"" is a real Southern Baptist shouter, but it's the tunes that start off in a gentle slide that most clearly demonstrate Franklin's mastery: ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" ""What A Friend We Have In Jesus,"" and ""Amazing Grace.""
There's even a great instrumental, Baptized version of George Harrison's ""My Sweet Lord.""

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00P6Y1J14,1,1,4,"Cincinnati-based Walk the Moon released their debut album for RCA two years ago and followed that with an even better EP in early 2013 called ""Tightrope"". After endless touring, the guys finally have recorded a new album. After a first single in September (""Shut Up and Dance""), now comes the second single, just weeks ahead of the new album's release.

""Different Colors"" (3'17"") is the sophomore single of the upcoming album, and this is pure 'classic' WTM sound. The band sounds like they're having fun, and the song makes you want to get up and sing along, in particular when the chorus comes on: ""Say uh uh uh uh/Different colors/Uh uh uh uh/We paint each other"", ha! Who even would want to resist that? Note: the body-painting theme, so prominent in the band's early days, seems to have returned (at least in the lyrics). Bottom line: this seems to indicate more fun times are coming our way on WTM's upcoming second album for RCA, ""Talking Is Hard"", which is due for release in early December..

You haven't had the full experience of Walk the Moon if you haven't seen them in concert. Being in Cincinnati, I've seen them plenty of times over the years. Most recently, they played here in August on the ""Gospel"" tour along with Panic! At the Disco, and they blew up the roof, once again. Then they presented two new songs, ""Shut Up and Dance"", and the Talking Heads-influenced ""Spend Your $$$"", which are both on the new album. Can't wait for that. Meanwhile, ""Different Colors"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","that with an even better EP in early 2013 called "" Tightrope "" . and this is pure ' classic ' WTM sound .

""And if our love was meant to be, hey, girl, find a way to save it."" -L.T.D., featuring lyrics by Jeffrey L. Osbourne & Sam Dees

Five EMOTIONAL Stars. While he was still with the group ""L.T.D."" (Love Togetherness & Devotion), singer, songwriter Jeffrey Osborne demonstrated he was one of the greatest lead voices in soul and R&B, although he was soon destined to leave L.T.D. after a decade to start a brilliant platinum-selling solo career. Here he sings his tale of a man trying to get back with his girlfriend, wanting to know ""Where Did We Go Wrong?"". L.T.D.'s background harmonizing blends wonderfully with Jeffrey's distinctive and heartfelt voice, especially with those long breathless notes. This is a fantastic soulful ballad that gets My Highest Recommendation. Five WONDERFUL Stars. (A&M records. 1-MP3 track. X-Ray lyrics. Time-4:28.)","And if our love was meant to be , hey , girl , find a way to save it . "" -L.T.D. , featuring lyrics by Jeffrey L. Osbourne & Sam Dees

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B0013F5N62,1,1,5,"I listen to a wide range of music, and often I don't realize that a particular song I enjoy isn't a modern release until I look up more information about it online.  I frequently heard John ""Cougar"" Mellencamp's ""Jack and Diane"" on a ""lite"" radio station in the 2000s, but always thought it was a recent release -- it wasn't until recently that I learned it actually came out in the early '80s.  This doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the song, however -- I enjoy older music more than most modern music, and '80s music especially.  And this particular song is a fun and thoughtful one, upbeat but with lyrics that anyone can appreciate.

A mellower rock song with electric and acoustic guitars as the main instruments (the drums are more subdued up until the bridge), this song showcases the titular teens as the main characters -- two kids growing up in a small town in America's heartland, entertaining dreams of the future and enjoying each other's company.  Even as they make big plans for the future, the chorus and the bridge counsel them to hang onto their youth as long as they can, because everyone grows up eventually, and there's no returning to the days of your youth.  After all ""life goes on, long after the thrill of living is done.""

Whether or not you agree with that sentiment (there's still the old adages of ""age is only a number"" and ""growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional,"" after all), this is still a powerful song, sort of a grown-up version of Kenny Loggins' ""Return to Pooh Corner.""  While the singer of the former longs for a return to the days of childhood, John Mellencamp seems content to reminisce on the teenage years, and accepts that they won't come back and it's best to enjoy them as long as you can.

A very enjoyable rock number, one that transcends its era and is timely even to modern audiences.","that a particular song I enjoy is not a modern release until I look up more information about it online .

My children quickly learned the words to this song and would sing it in church without looking at the lyrics.  Since our music director's passing, it has taken on an even more powerful meaning.

I've been a fan of Chris Tomlin off and on over the years, but I have to admit that this song snuck up on me.  It's a great song, and I highly recommend it.","yet powerful praise and worship song .

'Better' (going by the audio samples here) feels like the kind of album that really should've followed his sophomore release 'I Remember You' back in the late-90's. While that particular album focused primarily on the piano-heavy ballads, 'Better' effectively showcases a more energetic, uptempo side of Brian that he struggled to master a bit earlier on in his career. The production also stands out as well (best since 2005's solid yet largely uneven 'Gemini'), with polished LIVE musicianship and arrangements galore. I think there was only ONE track total that featured any hint of programmed instrumentation (the one with guest rapper Glasses Malone?), but it really didn't deter from the overall flow of the album which tells me that Brian definitely has learned his lesson in terms of not letting ""trendy"" guest artists (rappers ESPECIALLY) overtake his studio projects. I do like his reggae-inspired collaboration with native Hawaiian singer Kimie Miner, however. Didn't see that one coming, but it was a most welcome surprise indeed! Hopefully, this newfound sense of musical versatility will continue for Brian as he takes on further projects in the not-too-distant future. From my honest perspective, the man certainly needs to make up for lost time after giving much of his core fanbase three decades worth of watered-down compromises that served him well financially yet stagnated him artistically during that stretch.","Sounds like Brian 's finally snapping out of that 20 - year commercial "" haze "" which very nearly swallowed whatever remained of his credibility as a legit multi - talented recording artist .

But what it really needs is a bunch of spacey noise and auto-tune. And more freakouts and distortion and weirdness for the sake of weirdness. Yeah, that would make this album awesome.""

Then, lo and behold, the Flaming Lips and their ""fwends"" release this album. Wow, it's like fate!

Back to reality...

I've been a fan of the Flaming Lips since the 90s. They have released some excellent albums that will stand the test of time. Unfortunately, they've become a band of gimmicks as of late (gummy skulls, ridiculously long songs, blood, etc.). This is the worst gimmick of all. This is a complete embarrassment to music. The cover of ""Lucy"" was enough on its own. Was it really necessary to cover an entire classic album? That's a question that really doesn't need to be answered out loud.

Is it worth listening to this? Maybe once, just to experience the horror. However, I will leave you with this warning: you will never be able to forget you listened to this travesty. I only hope that one day I can again listen to Sgt Pepper without being reminded that this atrocity exists.","and thinking to myself , "" Man , this album is okay .

This is by far their greatest album which they received recognition for from the Grammy's. I'm not sure about the ladies but all the guys definitely loved Stevie Nicks and followed her career after this one. I highly recommend it. One of the all time best albums I have ever heard and although much of the music of other bands and singers goes by the wayside with age, this one does not. You can't help thinking that the edginess of the band in a state of turmoil from broken relationships actually inspired them to write so many hits for one album. If you don't think so, you can ""Go Your Own Way"".

Hello, from the other side, I must have called a thousand times

(Courtesy of Amazon Prime)
Five POWERFUL Stars. From the multi-award winning album 25, this is a marvelous, deliberately-building performance by multi-Grammy award winning singer, songwriter Adele performing Hello backed only by a piano and strings: no other instruments needed. Its about a distant love, an old love affair that still haunts her, and a need for closure. She takes the lyric for a memorable, emotional, thrill ride. The song won Song of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance and Record of the Year. My Highest Recommendation. Five SOARING Stars. (XL Recordings/Columbia. 1-MP3 track.

Well, add another name to the list--Cleo Laine.  This beautiful, British songbird is phenomenally talented and I am surprised that we haven't heard more of her, and that her name isn't more well-recognized.  Her lower register is flawless, sexy and carries the grace and the depth of the songs, featured here, with minimal accompaniment (just subtle chords from her pianist).

A329PQ0WJOIZL5,B009VLX8FS,1,1,5,"I became a Taylor Swift fan right out of the gate when her debut album dropped in late 2006.  And she wasn't just ANY country gal; she could sing it like the rest of them!  She let the world know who she was and that she meant business.  Several years later -- and several EP's in between -- Taylor's next big record is yet another mega-smash.  Quite simply, a lot of the songs on here are hit-packed.

For example, there's the upbeat title track -- which is also one of my personal favorites.  Then you have the two pop crossover hits currently on heavy rotation:  ""I Knew You Were Trouble"" and ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.""  Speaking of that, I loved watching Taylor's STELLAR performance of both songs on New Year's Rockin' Eve 2012 (which was just 2 weeks ago, mind you).  Yes, she knows how to bring it!

A few more of my favorite personal tracks are ""Stay Stay Stay"", ""The Lucky Ones"" and the duet with Mister Snow Patrol himself -- ""The Last Time.""  The pairing seems very fitting if you listen to how the song actually sounds.  Then there's ""Sad Beautiful Tragic"", another personal fave.

As most people already know, Taylor is known for writing a breakup song about one of her ex's.  But hey, it still makes for some great music, doesn't it?!  It's sometimes fun to guess just whom she is writing about.  But once in a while, she will step out of her usual comfort zone to write a third-person view song, such as for The Hunger Games soundtrack (i.e., ""Eyes Open"".)  I truly don't believe that there's nothing Taylor CAN'T do.  She has truly outdone herself, so I look forward to what she brings for her next album.","I became a Taylor Swift fan right out of the gate And she was not just ANY country gal ; she could sing it like the rest of them ! yet another mega - smash .

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B0092MKTL2,1,1,4,"Like many, I was introduced to Imagine Dragons by their hit ""Radioactive,"" which proved popular enough that it was not only included on the soundtrack to the movie ""The Host,"" but was covered by Pentatonix and parodied by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic.  At first I thought it would be a case of ""I just like one song by this group,"" but when I listened to their song ""Warriors,"" I knew I would like this band.  I'm normally not a fan of modern rock, but Imagine Dragons is quickly proving to be the exception, and their album ""Night Visions"" has really grown on me.

Of the songs on this album, ""Radioactive"" and ""On Top of the World"" would have to be my favorite songs.  The former is a thunderous and raw song, but strangely hopeful despite the dystopian, post-apocalyptic theme of it.  ""On Top of the World"" is quite different, a livelier and upbeat number that wouldn't be out of place in a Dreamworks movie.  Both songs have hooked me, and evoke very different but still powerful emotions every time I listen to them.

Other favorites on this album include the pop-flavored ""Tip Toe,"" the powerful ""Demons,"" and the more subdued but still thoughtful and pleasant ""Amsterdam.""  Other songs, such as ""Underdog"" and ""Bleeding Out,"" aren't necessarily bad, they just weren't my favorites of the album.  Still, overall this album has far more hits than misses for me.  Imagine Dragons has a powerful sound to it that can be raw, melancholy, upbeat, or mellow as they see fit, and they've certainly proven to be a great band with this album.

If you like bands such as Linkin Park or Dashboard Confessional, you'll probably enjoy ""Night Visions.""  Give it a shot.

Still , overall this album has far more hits than misses for me . Imagine Dragons has a powerful sound to it that can be raw , melancholy , upbeat , or mellow as they see fit , and they have certainly proven to be a great band with this album . If you like bands such as Linkin Park or Dashboard Confessional , you will probably enjoy "" Night Visions . """
A25KDGSE2EVYXY,B000W21ER4,1,1,4,"This is Weezer's first ever album, and I think it's pretty good. I think Raditude might be my first favorite. I think this is a good album for anybody who needs a nice rockin' tune to listen to, but it's not quite hard-rock enough to be like Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins. The music is also very creative and original, much different from all the grunge that was released back in 1994. Best of all, it's timeless! Each song has at least something to say about it.

""My Name is Jonas"" might be a song about the singer's brother, since the actual singer's name is Rivers. A punk rock song with a light guitar intro. The only bad thing is that the rhythm is kind of hard to find at first.

The Amazon sample for ""No One Else"" says ""My girl's got eyeballs,"" but the whole line is ""My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head."" The music is fun, catchy, and a little simple.

""The World Has Turned And Left Me Here"" is so Weezer-y, you can almost immediately tell who sang it if you hear it for the first time on the radio. I would've given it a 5/5, but it kind of got old after a while.

""Buddy Holly"" is Awesome! Does Rivers really look like Buddy Holly? Kinda, kinda not.

Next comes ""Undone"", which isn't the kind of song that's meant to be played on the radio. It starts of as a pretty decent Weezer song, but it's a bit long. Rivers starts singing at 0:52 [after a conversation sound-clip with two people] and stops singing at around 3:20, then the music gets annoyingly intense at 3:52. Once it dies down, we just start hearing some microphone feedback and some ominous piano chords. I think it'd be much better off without them.

""Surf Wax America"" is a nice song that makes you want to go surfing [or take your board to work, as Rivers says]. But like the previous song, it has something that I wish it didn't have--the middle section. I know they're trying to sound cool and slowed down, but why is it so quiet?! I heard Holiday before this one, so I thought Holiday was the only song to have a middle section like that, which would make it seem more original. [Before I bought this album I had the songs Buddy Holly, Undone, Say It Ain't So, and Holiday] Other than that, I guess it's cool song.

Next comes ""Say It Ain't So"". This one has everything that a Weezer fan would like; Pretty good lyrics, rockin' chorus, guitar solo, and it's really catchy. Say it IS so!

Somebody said that ""In The Garage"" this one is an anthem for nerds/ rock 'n' roll lovers, and I might have to agree. It's my favorite song on the album. I like the intro because it sounds so different from the rest of the song. [Is that a bagpipe?]

""Holiday"" is a bluesy song about setting off for adventure. Yes, it has a middle section, but much louder and better than the one SWA had.

""Only in Dreams"" is the finishing song, and it sounds EXACTLY like Undone at first, but it later starts to sound like a big mix of every other song on the album, so it makes a great last song [8 minutes]. But it had a lot of mic feedback at the end and Rivers stopped singing early again, so I'm not so sure about it. It got quiet like Surf Wax America and Holiday, but that's not exactly a middle section, since no one was singing, and because it happened towards the end. Long story short, it's a good last song, though it kind of sounds like Undone. [5/10]

Now for the bonus tracks:

For ""Mykel and Carley"", I'm not so sure who Mykel and Carley are, but the song was great! It had a guitar intro that reminded me of the intro for My Name is Jonas. Unusually it was also a bonus track for the band's newest album, Death to False Metal.

""Jamie"" is Just boring. Enough said.

However, ""Susanne"" is Another great hit from Weezer!]

Finally, we have ""PaperFace"". I have no idea what that means, but the actual song was just annoying. Rivers starts off singing quietly, until the tension in his voice builds up and enters the chorus. The chorus really annoyed me because Rivers is screaming his lungs out while the rest of the band is banging as hard as they can on their instruments. Once AGAIN, there's another middle section. Just don't really like it.","and I think it is pretty good . I think Raditude might be my first favorite .

While she has had some great songs to begin with like Underneath Your Clothes and Hips Don't Lie, but lately her songs just haven't really hit the nail on the head not for her, but with the people she has recorded with that have been more wasted in voice and heart. Her collaboration with the overexposed Rihanna on Can't Remember To Forget You. the lead single from her self-titled record isn't actually a strong cup of tea from the two of them. In fact, Rihanna throws the song away, not just in heart, but in voice as well. I actually found this collaboration to be worse than even when Shakira collaborated with Beyonce' on Beautiful Liar nearly a decade ago. Perhaps Shakira could find better to not forget when her next collaboration comes out down the road.

A3L9FT8OJY4Q6I,B00Y3ZZOH2,1,1,4,"Four discs-66,55,53,53 minutes each approximately.  The discs are in individual cardboard holders,which are slipped into an open side of the cardboard box. The booklet lists venues,dates,and who played on the individual tracks.  There is an introduction written by Petty about the making of this box set. The sound (newly mixed),from various venues across 30 years,is uniformly good.  The retro style packaging is perfectly in keeping with Petty's approach to music-when a well made and assembled vinyl album  made a True r&r  statement for an entire (including Petty) generation of listeners.

In this day and age of over-priced ""deluxe"" releases/re-releases,even of admittedly great r&r,this collection stands apart.  Not only are all the tracks heard here chosen by Petty,guitarist Mike Campbell,and their producer,the tracks cover 30 years of TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS in concert.  Great music,nice packaging,and a low price make this worth owning.  Petty and his band are one of the few groups still playing music that  matters.  Listen to any track on this collection,and you'll have all the proof you need,no matter if the song is well known,or a live rarity.  Their musical sound and approach have changed little over 30 years.  Their combination of influences of Dylan/BYRDS,and rootsy garage rock,combined with a bit of the British Invasion sound,have served as the foundation for their sound from the beginning.  And that's what gives their music backbone.  On these tracks the band effortlessly switches across musical styles,from originals to covers,all with that sound they've played from the beginning.

All the tracks on this set are on an equal footing,from ballads to all out rockers.  Long time listeners of the band will need little proof of the great music here.  If for some reason you aren't to familiar with the band,and want a lot of their greatest songs (""Breakdown"",""Refugee"",""American Girl"",etc.),along with some great covers (THUNDERCLAP NEWMAN's ""Something In The Air"",BOOKER T. AND THE M.G.'S ""Green Onions"",just two examples),with the added electricity of a live performance-this is it.  With hundreds of hours of live material to choose from,distilled down to four discs,a lot of musical ground is covered.  Arguably some listeners will wish a certain song was included (personally I would like to hear more Dylan/BYRDS covers),but overall,this is an outstanding overview from one of the few long time bands that still matters.

For anyone who wants to hear music that is important,but more importantly,exciting and visceral,and that guarantees a good time,this is the set to get.  Still,listening to this great music makes you wonder-what more great music is still left on the reels?  But this collection goes a long way in satisfying that craving (like mine) for a generous overview of TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS doing what they do best-performing great r&r in front of an audience.  With that inimitable sound the band has built on all these years,you get the feeling that this band believes in the power and redemption of basic r&r.  This set is even better than the 2 CD set released by Immortal,taken from a concert in 2003,in Chicago.

Do your head a favor and purchase this wonderful collection soon.  And then sit back and listen to some music from one of the few long time bands that can still rock and roll.","and who played on the individual tracks . who played on the individual tracks .

ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00A4NWSDK,-1,-1,2,"I hated to rate Kid Rock's last album ""Born Free"" so low, but nothing on that album stood out to me as something that would be a classic, it may have gone to #1 in the US and done fairly well around the world, but that was fans anticipation that Kid's latest album would be great, but the proof is seen in how many songs you remember now, how many have radio play, how many clips where made and remembered and the singles chart positions.

I am glad Kid Rock abandoned using Rick Ruban's help to produce this album, as it does sound a bit more like Kid Rock now. However, I was excited to not only hear that, but that Kid wanted this album to be something more like ""Cocky"" which to me is one of his best albums yet where I enjoy listening to that album almost from start to finish. But what has been the outcome here on ""Rebel Soul"" has been rather disappointing for me.

The opening song ""Chickens In The Pen"" is not a strong opener, nor is it a great song. Usually upon hearing the first track of an album, it sets the mood for what is about to come, but like on ""Born Free"" the first track here made my heart sink that this album was not going to put Kid back on top of his game. The lyrics are too weird for me to even understand what Kid was going for on this track. I thought maybe it would be tongue in cheek lyrics, but ""the mule keeps kickin' the chickens in the pen, Let's rock all night and then do it again"" I dunno... I just expect better from Kid Rock. The song is just too stupid to be good if you ask me.

Lets Ride - it sounds like Kid has taken a real liking to the 60's and 70's sound of Rock N roll bands like 'The Who' and 'Alice Cooper'. It's certainly not a bad thing at all, however the song comes off sounding pretty average for it's genre.

Catt Boogie - About the same as ""Lets Ride"", its decent, but not all that memorable.

Detroit Michigan - OK, KID. WE GET IT ALREADY, YOU ARE FROM DETROIT, BUT PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop singing about it. The lyrics sound good, the melody is pretty good, up until the chorus, it just doesn't sit right in the song. A song that could have been good, but he does a better job with this type of thing later on the album.

Rebel Soul - I expected a title like this to be southern rock, but it sounds country to me. Kid's done some great country songs, but this song here to me is not worthy of naming the whole album after. Definitely a filler sounding track.

God Save Rock N Roll - What is Kid thinking these days? First Rebel Soul is not southern rock, yet this one here has ROCK N ROLL in the title and is a country tune? Next.

Happy New Year - This is a cover song? Why did Kid chose to cover this song? It's pretty simple lyrics, and i'm convinced Kid can do much better then this. I was surprised to see this song was leading the votes of favorite song from this album on Kid's website... why, I just don't know?

Celebrate - Not a bad song, but like track 2 and 3, it is easy to forget, but amongst the rest of this album, it's one of the better ones on here.

The Mirror - I absolutely hate auto-tuners. Kid doesn't need to use them, and ruined what could have been a decent slow song had he not used those annoying stupid auto-tuners that should be banned from anyone being able to record with. I did say something the same on Alice Cooper's last album, and was informed that it was an effect and not an auto-tuner, so if that's the case with this song too, then Bathroom Bobby, never EVER use that effect ever again, it sounds horrible.

Mr Rock N Roll - I was losing faith that there wasn't going to be a stand out song on this album, and i'd be reviewing it the same way I did Kid's last album, but Mr Rock N Roll showed up and brightened my day. I wouldn't say this song is 5 of 5 stars, but it's around the 4 mark. It's my favorite track on this album, and easy to get into and rock with. The lyrics are great, has a lot of familiar names of classic songs in it, and is worthy of Kid adding this track to his live shows.

Cucci Galore - At first I thought, WTF is this $#!%? lyrics spewing out of ""My names Cucci, Cucci, Cucci galore"" and repeating. Then a screaming rock chorus of ""Do you wanna go down""... the song makes little sense to me other than it's a typical Kid Rock bragging about having money, fame, women and hot tubs etc... but as weird as the lyrics are, and a WTF imprint it left after the first listen... for some reason, it's not a bad track, as much as it makes little sense, it's catchy.. and about the only song on here that has any boom bass in it, where as most of the other songs on here are classic rock or country sounding, this one combines a bit of rock with a sort of hip hop beat to it. Weirdly, this track grew on me!

Redneck Paradise - Euhhh, seems like Kid has done this song before. I'd rather better red neck songs about drinking or ""Born To Be a Hick"" over this feel good attempt at a trailer park sing-along filler.

Cocaine and Gin - Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, I take back that thing I said about rather listening to drinking songs... only when they rock, this one is just a filler for boredom.

Midnight Ferry - I was so sick of hearing halleluiah preachy songs by this point that I just can't even get to the end of this track. Not a good way to close the album. Kid has said he wants this song played at his funeral, I would take ""Only God Knows Why"" over this any day and any night.

I added up my ratings, and can only give this album a 1.9... a bit higher then the last album, but far from the 4 to 5 star ratings for albums Kid has done in the past. Just to be clear, no, I am not a rap or hip hop fan, so with those sounds being absent here have not left me bitter, but I do miss the heavier sound of songs like ""So Hott"", ""American Baddass"" and Kid's earlier album sounds... I do miss The Twisted Brown Trucker Band... plus, what I would have loved to hear was songs like on ""Cocky"" that started off slow, then rocked your @$$ off by the end. Hopefully Kid Rock will return to that sound on the next album. But even so, the songs on here, there are a few decent tracks, but only one or two worthy of being included during live shows, but only barely worthy of being called a hit song... not something I would be disappointed by if they didn't appear on a greatest hits album in future... but compared to Kid's best stuff, really only Mr Rock N Roll would be worthy of standing next to them... but again, not hard to understand if it was passed by as a greatest hits selection.","I hated to rate Kid Rock 's last album "" Born Free "" so low , that would be a classic , it may have gone to # 1 in the US and done fairly well around the world , but that was fans anticipation that was fans anticipation that Kid 's latest album would be great , but the proof is seen in how many songs you remember now , how many have radio play , how many clips I am glad Kid Rock abandoned using Rick Ruban 's help to produce this album , as it does sound a bit more like Kid Rock now . However , I was excited to not only hear but that Kid wanted this album to be something more like "" Cocky "" that Kid wanted this album to be something more like "" Cocky "" which to me is one of his best albums yet where I enjoy listening to where I enjoy listening to But what has been the outcome here on "" Rebel Soul "" has been rather disappointing for me . The opening song "" Chickens In The Pen "" is not a strong opener , nor is it a great song . but like on "" Born Free "" the first track here made my heart sink that this album was not going to put Kid back on top of his game . The lyrics are too weird for me to even understand what Kid was going for on this track . I just expect better from Kid Rock . The song is just too stupid to be good if you ask me . Let Us Ride - it sounds like Kid has taken a real liking to the 60 's and 70 's sound of Rock N roll bands like ' The It is certainly not a bad thing at all , however the song comes off sounding pretty average for it is genre . Catt Boogie - About the same as "" Let Us Ride "" , its decent , that memorable . Detroit Michigan - OK , KID . BUT PLEASE , PLEASE , PLEASE stop singing about it . The lyrics sound good , the melody is pretty good , up until the chorus , it just does not sit right in the song . that could have been good , but he does a better job with this type of thing later on the album . Rebel Soul - I expected a title like this to be southern rock , Kid 's done some great country songs , but this song here to me is not worthy of naming the whole album after . Definitely a filler sounding track . God Save Rock N Roll - What is Kid thinking these days ? First Rebel Soul is not southern rock , Happy New Year - It is pretty simple lyrics , and i am convinced Kid can do much better then this . I was surprised to see this song was leading the votes of favorite song from this album on Kid 's website ... Celebrate - Not a bad song , but like track 2 and 3 , it is easy to forget , but amongst the rest of this album , it is one of the better ones on here . The Mirror - I absolutely hate auto - tuners . and ruined what could have been a decent slow song had he not used those annoying stupid auto - tuners that should be banned from anyone being able to record with . that effect ever again , it sounds horrible . Mr Rock N Roll - I was losing faith and brightened my day . It is my favorite track on this album , and easy to get into The lyrics are great , has a lot of familiar names of classic songs in it , and is worthy of Kid adding this track to his live shows . Cucci Galore - At first I thought , WTF is this $ # ! % ? lyrics spewing out of "" My names Cucci , Cucci , Cucci galore "" Then a screaming rock chorus of "" Do you want to go down "" ... the song makes little sense to me other than it is a typical Kid Rock bragging about having money , fame , women and hot tubs etc ... but as weird as the lyrics are , and a WTF imprint it left after the first listen ... for some reason , it is not a bad track , as much as it makes little sense , it is catchy .. that has any boom bass in it , where as most of the other songs on here are classic rock Weirdly , this track grew on me ! Redneck Paradise - Euhhh , seems like Kid has done this song before . I would rather better red neck songs about drinking or "" Born To Be a Hick "" over this feel good attempt at a trailer park sing - along filler . when they rock , this one is just a filler for boredom . Midnight Ferry - I was so sick of hearing halleluiah preachy songs by this point Not a good way to close the album . Kid has said he wants this song played at his funeral , I would take "" Only God Knows Just to be clear , no , I am not a rap or hip hop fan , so with those sounds being absent here have not left me bitter , but I do miss the heavier sound of songs like "" So Hott "" , "" American Baddass "" I do miss The Twisted Brown Trucker Band ... plus , what I would have loved to hear was songs like on "" Cocky "" that started off slow , then rocked your @$$ off by the end . Hopefully Kid Rock will return to But even so , the songs on here , there are a few decent tracks , or two worthy of being included during live shows , but only barely worthy of being called a hit song ... not something I would be disappointed by if they did not appear on a greatest hits album in future ... but compared to Kid 's best stuff , really only Mr Rock N Roll would be worthy of standing next to them ... but again , not hard to understand if it was passed by as a greatest hits selection ."

""Return to Paradise"" might just be; what with those beautiful Falsetto vocals, ""Georgia"" might  be an under-rated one of those Southern Anthems that filled up ""Tumbleweed Connection"". But, for me, the real nuggets are the final three songs ""Madness"", ""Reverie"" and ""Song for Guy"", which all sit well together, kind of a trio of darkness, really; ""Madness"" is a spine chilling disco-prog-rocker with lots of haunting piano chords; ""Reverie"" is brief but effective, and ""Song for Guy"" is suitably melancholy and ethereal, given it's essentially a requiem. The vocal part is particularly evocative.

The other songs aren't bad. ""I don't care"" is a fun rocker in the style of his earlier ones, but the vocals don't relay the fun.

A3S9IDI1V2WQQ1,B00EWS5IO4,1,-1,3,"This is a review of ""Miami pop festival"" the Jimi Hendrix experience. I liberated a copy of this CD from a local big box store tonight, before it's True release. So I have listened to it twice and here is my take: for $9.99, this is a three star purchase. There is some interesting banter and a tuning session by Jimi, which showcases just how novel these large festivals were in the late 60s. This particular festival was set in May of 1968 and promoted by Michael Lang, of pre-Woodstock fame.

The songs on this live disc come mainly from ""Are You Experienced...?"" even though it's mid '68. The first track is a funny little whimsical 60s back and forth that descends into the tuning session referenced earlier.  Track two opens with a cool jam intro with punching kick drums from Mitch Mitchell and phased out feedback laden guitar from Jimi- just before launching into a nicely rearranged introduction of ""hey Joe."" The solo in this song really kicks. The next song, Foxy Lady, blasts off. The intro contains a whole lotta Uni-Vibe and phasing. One nice aspect is that the mixes, which were done originally by Kramer and then later remixed for this project by Eddie Kramer are tight.

 The next song ""Tax-free"" is a nice jam with some heavy crybaby floating throughout. Noel Redding's bass guitar is right up there in the mix in the correct place, sonically speaking. Mitch has a cool tempo altering drum solo that really starts swinging as Jimmy comes back in with some blistering wah-wah guitar. The on and off mic banter is amusing and entertaining, as it shows just how novel and inexperienced the promoters and the sound technicians were at setting up these kinds of shows in the early, nascent  stages of festival going.

 I will avoid the common bashing of Janie Hendrix and the whole experience Hendrix cash grab machine that so many complain about. What else can be said about this process? There is very limited material that Mr. Hendrix produced while he was alive. Most of it has already been heard many times over. We are scraping the bottom of the barrel, of course, ending up with products like ""Valleys of Neptune ""which was decent and acceptable and overall a good listen. So with all of that said, this is a decent product. In fact it is rather good for a live recording. The only problem is the lack of material. The fact that two songs are repeated is troubling.

The accompanying booklet with photographs that show Jimmy with his Olympic white Fender Strat are very nice and well done. The packaging is actually quite nice as well. So for $10, this is a marginal three-star buy. Put some other records ahead of it in your musical shopping list, like Paul McCartney's new album or even some of those dreaded repackagings of prior releases that I loathe. The only one I would say to avoid at all costs is The Band at the Academy of Arts (aka ""Rock of Aged""). That one is a great example of a lame cash grab. Sad for such an amazing group. Ive heard NOTHING good about it!

PS-I would listen to this a million times before ever suffering through friggin' ARCADE FIRE and their Ambien-rock-electronic crap that Rolling Stone seems to love so much.

A26NLSTT75FMJM,B005MVLI8A,1,1,4,"...but it's still excellent throughout, though just SLIGHTLY overrated. How could a four-star disc be overrated, you ask? Well, I don't hear the voice of God in every track. I do in most, but a couple in the end kinda bored me - On a Plain sounded much better Unplugged, and there's just no saving tripe like Territorial Pissings, Lounge Act or Stay Away.

Now, let's get to the GOOD stuff! Yeah, there's plenty of that. For starters is the deserved smash Smells Like Teen Spirit - heavy yet melodic, hard-rocking yet vunerable, with one of the best guitar riffs of the '90's, yadda yadda yadda. All the praise you've heard about it is True. Even better is Lithium, disturbing yet unforgettable lyrics and a stick-in-your-mind, Dazed and Confused-esque descending bassline. And lotsa melody. Which is one reason I love Nirvana - Cobain's melodies were exquisite. Come As You Are is higlighted by a downright unforgettable ringing riff, In Bloom by a strong drum track and snarled refrain. Polly deals with rape in a disturbingly stark way, drawing you in while scaring you off. Breed and Drain You are some pretty raw, rockin' stuff, the kind of song the group did best. These were the hits, but how could anybody let the droning, mesmeric closer Something in the Way slip under the radar? Totally underrated song, I think. And then there's that insane hidden track, Endless Nameless or whatever... whoa. Pure craziness.

Not the best record of the '90's (Dirt), or even the best Nirvana album (In Utero). But it's the place to start, not only with the group but with alt-rock in general.

I say screw all the angsty alt-rockers that were influenced by this album's lyrics. Kurt really was an alienated guy (he didn't WANT to be famous, for the love of Buddha!), and was communicating genuine emotions. As opposed to all these other morons, who whine about being ""misunderstood"" simply to make money.

To close this rather wordy review, Nirvana (and Pearl Jam, and the rest of them) came just in time, justly knocking those stupid hair-metal bands off the charts and replacing them with a new golden age for rock rivaling the creatively fertile 1965-1975 period. It's a shame that, after this, crap groups like Green Day (who were essentially riding Nirvana's coattails), Oasis, MCR and Slipknot became popular...","but it is still excellent throughout , though just SLIGHTLY overrated .

A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000W1W96K,1,1,4,"After Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas were Motown's biggest female stars.  But whereas the Supremes offered listeners sophistication the music of Reeves was more in the gospel tradition.  Reeves got her big break when she was a secretary at Motown and Mary Wells failed to show up for a recording session.  The song, ""I'll Have to Let Him Go,"" which is not included in this collection, was the first song credited to the suddenly created Martha & the Vandellas.  The original Vandellas were Annette Sterling and Rosalind Holmes, although the lineup changed over the years; the name came from combining a couple of Detroit favorites, Van Dyke Street and local singer Della Reese).  The group's second single ""Come and Get These Memories"" made the Top 5 of the R&B charts and the girls were on their way.  Other Top 5 hits included ""Dancing in the Street,"" """"Nowhere to Run,"" ""Jimmy Mack,"" ""I'm Ready for Love,"" ""(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave,"" and ""Honey Chile.""  These danceable R&B hits made Martha & the Vandellas the chief rivals to the Supremes until 1968, when Reeves had a nervous breakdown after a bad acid trip.  The group disbanded after a farewell concert in Detroit in 1973 and after an undistinguished solo career away from Motown, Reeves was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 1995.  This Millennium Collection offers up all of the group's hits, but is limited to only 11 cuts.  Consequently, while this album certainly covers the basics there is more of Martha & the Vandellas out there for you to enjoy.","Reeves got her big break and Mary Wells failed to show up for a recording session . which is not included in this collection , was the first song credited to the suddenly created Martha & the Vandellas .

They are returning to rock after a short jaunt into country that was not accepted.  They lost their name, and now they are trying to move into mainstream rock.  They have exceeded even some of their early albums that were hit oriented rather than quality.  Eventually this album will be recognized for the wonderful songs that never get old.  The band is recovering from the forces that would take them away from what they are good at, and I'm sure some of the band members also are questioning the direction they're going now.  Sometimes it's a step process, and this was a very good first step.  I've listened to these songs over and over, and only then do you appreciate the effort that went into making them.

This is very True of David Wahler's second album, A Star Danced. The elaborate and elegant digipak design casts a charming-looking bear dancing under the stars, and the music conveys the same celestial, wondrous feel.

Composed and performed entirely by Wahler on keyboards and synthesizers, with a guest appearance by guitarist Brent Gunter on ""The Seeds of Time,"" the music is a magical mix of sampled guitars, basses, drums, percussion, horns, and strings, resulting in a kaleidoscope of sound that exudes ethereal ambiance and cosmic sweep anchored by strong themes and melodic hooks. This is the perfect soundtrack for a long night drive under a starry sky.

The opening and closing tracks set and summate the tone for this sonically mystical album. ""Quest"" and its concluding reprise literally sound like a synthesis of Miles Davis and Herb Alpert soloing over layered textures by Vangelis and Tangerine Dream. The result is pure aural bliss.

The quality of the compositions, performances, and sounds recalls similar keyboard/synthesizer artists such as Michael Stribling, Pat Metheny collaborator Lyle Mays, Genesis member Tony Banks, and Miami Vice composer Jan Hammer.

Classic guitar riff, anyone who plays rock guitar has probably practiced it at some point in their lives. And of course there is the COWBELL! That SNL sketch was so brilliant, Christopher Walken 'THE Bruce Dickinson.' Yeah, the cowbell is fairly non-stop but it's low in the mix and often falls into a sonic blind spot so it tunes in and out of my consciousness. I think I almost typed couscousness there, ha ha that's what I was thinking...weird.

The guitar solo is pretty classic as well. Sometimes I wish they hadn't let the last note sustain so far into the verse, but not a deal breaker, Blue yster Cult. What a great name for a band. When I was younger, I thought they were scary, based on the cover of the 45 I had of Burnin for You. Ha ha, these guys are goofy. Where does one find blue oysters anyhow? Or is it a blue cult that worships oysters? Or does an umlaut over the 'o' mean something entirely different?

A26O6MQFA36WBK,B011AN05DM,-1,-1,3,"This was a hard one to write. As as huge fan of the Silversun Pickups, I've seen them in concert twice and have loved much of their body of work. They're a band that manages to create music that's both beautiful and heavy at the same time, with each of their albums featuring no shortage of standout moments and True emotion.

Better Nature, though, sees the Pickups choosing to hide their musical talents behind a wall of synth, releasing an album that's more electronic than instrumental, and one that as a result lacks much of what makes this band so great.

From the start, something doesn't feel right. The opening track Cradle sounds like it was intended to be a heavy one, from the vocals to the structure, but when you get to what should be a heavy chorus, the music simply continues at the same tempo and speed, leading to a track that on a first listen came across as almost forgettable. And as I listened to Better Nature for the first time, I felt my mind wandering and wondered why nothing in these songs was standing out to me.

Eventually I realized that the problem was the lack of guitar...or really, any instrument, throughout; Better Nature sees electronics and synthesizing used to imitate the sounds of instruments. You can hear electronic noise and effects that are meant to be the guitar, the drums, and the bass, but isn't. Much of Better Nature sounds like the soundtrack to a video game, and not a bad one, necessarily, but as a Silversun Pickups effort, it comes across as a watered down one.

It's tough for me to get into synth. I know that in the 80s it was big, (Latchkey Kids sounds almost like a throwback to that era) but my problem with seeing rock groups attempting to do this today (Linkin Park tried a similar style with Living Things, and Broken Bells with After the Disco) is that electronics, no matter how cool they can sound in their own genre, just can't achieve the dynamic feel to me of real instruments. I can hear, when listening to Better Nature, moments that were meant to soar, moments that were meant to be beautiful and emotional, moments that were meant to be heavy, but heard through this electronic filter, they feel muted, at times hardly registering. It makes for an album that can be catchy, but one that's ultimately forgettable, as there's just not much musically to grab onto, and I wouldn't say that anything on Better Nature even comes close to matching the best work on their previous records.

That's not to say that there's nothing here that's good. The two best songs on the CD (Nightlight and Circadian Rhythm) are strong tracks, though sadly, being the two singles, I'd already heard them before the album came out. These two songs had to have either been the first thing or the last thing recorded in these sessions, because they sound so different from the rest of the album that it's almost hard to believe. And even they don't get by unscathed, as the album version of Nightlight loses entirely the very cool and ominous buildup featured in the music video version of the song, something that makes this version decidedly inferior.

Elsewhere, Tapedeck stands out, and it, along with Latchkey Kids and Cradle, would I'm sure sound incredible with real instrumentation. Still, even as presented here, these are good songs, and generally the rest of the album's listenable and catchy, to varying degrees, but it doesn't sound like Silversun Pickups. Vocally it does (Both Brian Aubert and Nikki Monninger give incredible vocal performances throughout) but musically it sounds like someone doing electronic covers of Pickups songs, something that no matter how hard I try, I just can't get past.

Better Nature was a bummer for me. It's the album that I feared Neck of the Woods would be when I learned that Jacknife Lee would be producing it. Neck of the Woods, though, while it featured an increased use of electronics, was still definitely a Pickups album. Better Nature, though, just comes across as a synth album with Brian singing. Going by interviews the band has given, they seem very happy with the final product, and while I'm happy for them, I really hope that it's not a direction they continue on in the future. They're such a great band, and they're a band whose music needs to be fully heard, not run through an electronic filter.","This was a hard one to write .

A2N6LVH039X81N,B00CVHEIVW,1,1,5,"If some guy had told me around 1970, when I first started collecting classical LPs, that more than 40 years later I would be acquiring 37 hours recorded Bach for about $3, I would have told him ""Aw, go soak your head!"" (I was more eloquent back then!) However, this is exactly what's happened in the last couple of weeks.
First of all, the Bach Guild/Vanguard released its ""Bigger Bach Set"" (14 hours) for an introductory price of .99 cents, so I grabbed it. They also cut the price of their earlier Big Bach Set release (9 hours) back down to .99 cents, so I grabbed that at the same. Now VoxBox has released Bach's Complete Organ Works (14 hours), played by Walter Kraft, for $1.09, so of course I grabbed that immediately. That's 37 hours for a little over 3 bucks. Wow!
I'm wondering if Vox, with its massive back catalog of major and minor composers in job lots (they specialized in complete runs of somebody's output) has decided to get into the big and bigger MP3 download game, competing head to with Bach Guild (and like them leading with Bach). No doubt Vox noticed that these Bach Guild releases were shooting to #1 among classical MP3s, and sometimes to #1 among ALL MP3 downloads (including Rock). In fact, #1 in all MP3 downloads is exactly where this mega-set is right now.

I'm not a big organ music guy, but this seems like an excellent place to start. The sound seems to me very good for its vintage, and my family is complaining about the bass vibration from my downstairs office, so I guess they feel the same about the sound. The Kraft performance I've sampled (family static permitting) seem to me not virtuosic but soberly satisfying, which suits me fine for starters.

My advice would be to grab this while it's still $1.09. And I at least am going to keep my eye out for more VoxBox releases.","( I was more eloquent back then ! ) They also cut the price of their earlier Big Bach Set release ( 9 hours ) back down to .99 cents , so I grabbed Now VoxBox has released Bach 's Complete Organ Works ( 14 hours ) , played by Walter Kraft , for $ 1.09 , so of course I grabbed Wow ! and like them leading with Bach ) .

In December, as part of the ""25 Days of Free"" promotion, we got ""Winter Night.""  Now Little & Ashley are back, with ""Thousand Falling Stars.""

There's nothing earthshaking about this song, nothing groundbreaking.  It's a nice little pop song, with an electric guitar adding some energy to the breathy, mellow male vocals.  Perhaps because it's so very unpretentious, however, I couldn't help liking it - a lot.  Or maybe there's just something about the quiet joy of this song that reminds me of that moment when you realize you're falling in love, and anything seems possible.

ALR35EFI69S5R,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"This is an album for `everyman"", the definitive statement by Jackson Browne of his disturbing and apocalyptic view of contemporary society, and his hopes and fears for its future. It is also a lovely, stirring, and  evocative song cycle that illuminates Jackson Browne's unique vocal and  instrumental arrangements, and sends one running for the door to buy more  of the albums of the early ""JB"" variety. My personal favorites on this  wonderful album are ""Our Lady of the Well"", a interesting and fetching  suggestion of Browne's social and political concerns blended with a  celebration of the common rural peasantry of Latin America, ""Take It Easy""  written with Glenn Frye of the Eagles and recorded by both Browne and the  Eagles, ""These Times You've Come"" about an old pair of lovers who still see  each other romantically after parting, and of course, the combination song  cycle of ""Sing My Songs"" and ""For Everyman"", which like ""The Deluge"" on  another album, sets out Browne's fear of a pending eco-disaster and  apocalypse. Browne is still around, still creative, and still as socially  and politically outspoken, but this is one of his best early albums, when  he was one of the most talented and creative young folk-rock luminaries on  the popular scene, a superstar a long time in the making.  This is a  `must-have' album for any real fan of Browne's music and for anyone just  interested in top-shelf folk-rock music by one of the seventies and  eighties greatest popular artists.","This is an album for ` everyman "" , the definitive statement by Jackson Browne of his disturbing and apocalyptic view of contemporary society , and his hopes and fears for its future .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00FAEQ22G,1,1,4,"When it has came down to music this past year from female artists, it has lagged in heart and voice, and left behind by cheapness and poor taste from artists like Rihanna and Miley Cyrus. Yet, they have had poor taste in voice and heart. But there needs to be better balance. For newcomers like Lorde, she has a lot to prove, especially trying to follow up what British divas like Adele and Amy Winehouse have done so nicely. Her breakthrough single Royals is actually a very catchy song. I like the rhythm and simplicity of the song. It really lingers in what this past year showed with bad music, but good taste from Lorde. It definitely is better than joke songs like Blurred Lines or Wrecking Ball. Hopefully, there will be more good music from Lorde soon. She should have great songs, and shouldn't be labeled as a one-hit-wonder.

If anything, it proves Katy Perry doesn't always require a 'gimmick', and a song doesn't always have to be danceable for her to impress.

On the rock ballad ""Thinking Of You"", Katy sets aside the drum machines and synthesizers in favor of real guitars and drums.  With lyrics like ""You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter...like a hard candy with a surprise center"", she shows her depth as a songwriter.  But most impressive is the showcasing of her incredible vocal talent...something kept hidden on her previous singles.  From soft and sensual with a beautiful Falsetto, to strong and pure, and everything in between, this girl's got it.  At times her tone and delivery are reminiscent of Alanis Morissette, but I'm sure Katy wouldn't mind being compared to her.  Katy delivers a truly moving performance here...A+","when I am with him , I am thinking of you "" has been used hundreds of times before , in no way should one assume this song has nothing new to offer .

A15105Y7IL1FO9,B004X0XR94,1,1,4,"Unlike some high profile R&B artist, I will never get tired of buying a Musiq album. Each one has a different vibe. It is perfect that he has decided to drop another album to kick off the summer. ""Musiqinthemagiq"" comes just in time for the summer cookouts and family reunions.

First off Musiq is under a new management team. It may seem like boring news, but this has changed the style from what you are used to hearing from a Musiq album. Gone are long time collaborators Wayne Campbell, JR Totem & Orthodox Ransum. In are producers like August Rigo, The Element & Jesse Wilson. The problem with working with new producers is it takes time to gel. Songs like ""Silver&Gold"" takes Musiq in a place he doesn't need to be. ""Lovecontract"" has a weird Rapheal Saadiq sound. The lead single ""Anything"" gets the party started. This album is less on the slow jams (There are none) and heavy on dance grooves. ""Waitingstill"" is the closest to a slow song. The Jesse Wilson produced, ""Donthaveto"" is the gem of this album. It starts a trio of no skip songs including the beautifully written ""Bestfriend"" and ""Yes"".

Musiq has always has always been able to find a good medium between slow grooves and mid tempo songs. The lack of slow jams makes this album not as good as his last two. I rank this somewhere between ""Soulstar"" and ""Juslisen"". This album takes it back to his early ""Aijuswenasing"" days. As a long time Musiq fan, I enjoyed this album. A couple of his classic slow songs would have been nice. But overall I am not disappointed. I think there is no doubt that Musiq has been the most consistent male R&B artist over the past 10 years.","Unlike some high profile R&B artist , I will never get tired of buying a Musiq album .

A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B01AHKJS3W,1,1,5,"Seemingly out of nowhere, but brewing just underneath the surface of Nashvilles obsession with the tailgates, trucks, dirt roads, hot chicks, and faux redneck rap that is Bro Country (and its various offshoots), there has been a slow but sure resurfacing of country music rooted in both traditional and progressive values.  Guys like Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell, and Sturgill Simpson have been more or less leading this charge, but don't think the womenfolk are getting left behind.  If anything, as demonstrated over the past decade and a half, and counting Tift Merritt and Caitlin Rose among them, women are being seen as essential to this revitalization of the genre.  Enter Illinois native Margo Price with her album MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER, one of the great albums of any genre by anybody in the year 2016.

Much like Canadian gal Lindi Ortega had done in 2015 with FADED GLORYVILLE, Margo has done with this album, by mixing in a variety of styles, rooted in classic 1960s/1970s country, of the Bakersfield honky-tonk variety, but including a fair amount of Memphis/Muscle Shoals R&B and old-school country-rock of the Linda Ronstadt/Emmylou Harris variety as well.  Margo has had a fairly rough life up to this point (even seeing the wrong side of a jail cell), one that screams the story of a great C&W song, but being the survivor she is, of both jail and heartbreaks galore, she brings that to vivid life.  She took it upon herself to record MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER in the halls of Sun Studios in Memphis, the place where Elvis made his groundbreaking recordings that would help set the tone for American popular music in the second half of the 20th century, and this more than explains the musical mixings she engages in.  Songs like About To Find Out and Since You Put Me Down are classic-sounding honky-tonk material in a modern context.  Meanwhile, Weekender is a perfectly dissolute song about her time in jail, while Hurtin (On The Bottle), a co-write of Margos with the aforementioned Caitlin Rose, is another honky-tonk C&W masterpiece.  Other songs like Four Years Of Chances have a Southern R&B feel to them.

In any case, this isn't the sort of album thats likely to get too much airplay, on corporate country radio at least.  While there are no F-bombs dropped, there is a little bit of language in some of the songs lyrics that would give MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER the equivalent of the MPAAs PG rating.  And the combination of Telecaster twang and pedal steel guitar, a hallmark of classic 1960s Bakersfield honky-tonk and 1970s L.A. country-rock, must by now sound alien to people blinded by the processed junk of Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, and Florida-Georgia Line (to name just three Bromeister acts).  Still, all in all, thanks to Margos authenticity and a voice that is naturalistic, MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER has taken it all the way down the field for the touchdown.  It is essential listening, whether you're a fan of traditional country, a fan of progressive country, or, indeed, both.","but brewing just underneath the surface of Nashvilles obsession with the tailgates , trucks , dirt roads , hot chicks , and its various offshoots ) , there has been a slow but sure resurfacing of country music rooted in both traditional and progressive values .

Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those singers that has been more of a product than a real songstress. It is honestly very sad because she has made songs that have not really delivered, they have just been so overplayed like the manufactured voice at hand, not the songstress on the inside, unlike other divas that were worth something like Whitney Houston and Natalie Cole. When it came down to Ms. Knowles surprise album that she came out with in 2013, it actually has been more like a joke than a ""wow"" factor. Most of the songs have been more like jokes at hand, like Partition. She didn't feel like she igniting in the sex appeal, instead she felt more like a whimper overall. I really didn't like the song, and she really hasn't grown to be more of the diva at the absolute soul. Overall, if you are new to Beyonce's music, I would recommend passing his song up, and go to Crazy In Love, when she used to have a voice.

A3MXEBLOWCNL78,B00JL6C7L4,1,1,5,"Heartfelt, passionate, strong, and beautiful!  This music speaks to the heart like a lover speaks to their beloved.  From the opening track beginning with the cello and violins, the mood is passionate and longing, but then it changes over to powerful rhythm of drums and a male and female choir with a dramatic theme like a mighty army coming closer to its target.  Then, the music and the voices abruptly stop and you hear the echoes die in the spaciousness of what I picture as vaulted ceilings.  This music could well be used for a battle scene with intermittent cut scenes going back and forth with the main character remembering the person that he left behind.  This is the first soundtrack that I have bought from Audiomachine, and it will probably not be my last.  They know what they are doing, and they have truly produced some epic music on this album.  Some of the composers that Paul Dinletir and Kevin Rix like are Mozart, Beethoven, Debussy, Hans Zimmer, and Harry Gragson-Williams which are composers I like as well.  One of the elements that I think makes music great is the phrasing of the themes that the composer comes up with and the variations of the themes that they make after they have stated the main theme.  Another element that I believe makes music great is not just the notes, but the silence between the notes.  Claude Debussy stated, ""Music is the silence between the notes,"" and J. Krishnamurti stated, ""Listen both to the sound of the bell and to the silence between it's strokes.""  I like the phrasing that the composers have used of silence in their music, and they have created some great music.  As a case in point, take Track 2 with the beginning string's and the two-beat base, and they then add the theme with a female voice that hauntingly goes above this background rhythm like a crow flying over a desolate forest and landscape.  To strengthen the theme, the composers then use trumpets and horns to bring the theme more power and strength.  Then, unlike the first track, the composers do not go completely silent, but have about 4 measures with only the two-beat base going.  After that break, the music comes back with a heroic feeling of determination, like an army fighting against powerful odds.  I love piano music, and to me, it is like a violin, bringing out feelings of love and tenderness.  Track 3 starts out with just the piano playing a theme that denotes sadness, like someone may have just died, but soon it is joined by base, cello, and drums.  After this, a female voice begins the lament; powerful drums with a driving beat then pick up the pace.  Then, the musical journey begins over mountains, fording rivers, through dark valleys to reach the end of their quest for peace and some kind of meaning out of the sorrows of life.  I will not go through each track for music is meant to be listened to and felt, more than described and analyzed.  Each tack is wonderful to listen to, and it transports you wherever you let your imagination go.  Enjoy!","Heartfelt , passionate , strong , and beautiful !

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,"With a title like ""Fast Car,"" one would probably expect an upbeat, blood-pounding song in the vein of ""Shut Up and Drive"" or even ""Life Is a Highway.""  One certainly wouldn't expect a poignant, even melancholy ballad about escaping the drudgery of life... only to find oneself back where they started in the end.  And when I stopped and listened to the lyrics I was shocked at just how sad this song was... and yet was captivated by the unflinching portrait Tracy Chapman had painted of a young woman seeking the trap of her old life but finding herself reliving it anyhow.

It's not a happy song... yet Tracy Chapman sings it so beautifully.  Her wistful voice is never overwrought or melodramatic, conveying just the right amount of emotion to fit the theme of the song.  And the simple instrumentation keeps the song appropriately low-key.  Sometimes a beautiful song is spoiled by being overproduced or oversung, and it was nice to see the singer and producers resist that temptation here.

While a melancholy song, ""Fast Car"" is still lovely to listen to, and certainly more thoughtful than the endless parade of love songs that make up popular music nowadays.  If you like James Taylor, you might also enjoy ""Fast Car.""","With a title like "" Fast Car , "" one would probably expect an upbeat , blood - pounding song in the vein of "" Shut Up One certainly would not expect a poignant , even melancholy ballad about escaping the drudgery of life ... only to find oneself back when I stopped and listened to the lyrics I was shocked at just how sad this song was ... and yet was captivated by the unflinching portrait Tracy Chapman had painted of a young woman seeking the trap of her old life yet was captivated by the unflinching portrait Tracy Chapman had painted of a young woman seeking the trap of her old life It is not a happy song ... yet Tracy Chapman sings it so beautifully . or melodramatic , conveying just the right amount of emotion to fit the theme of the song .

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B0014JAM04,1,-1,2,"It seems to be a staple for rock groups to do a ballad, and even show off their softer side. Sometimes it comes off touching and sweet, sometimes darker and more haunting, and sometimes just plain amazing. See Hawk Nelson's brilliantly haunting ""Fourteen"" for case and point. But then again, sometimes it's just straight up ballad just for ballad's sake. Case in point, Secondhand Serenade's ""Fall For You.""

This piano ballad is about as boring as it is emotionless and unoriginal, and believe me, this will cause you to fall asleep at the wheel. It may please any AC fan, or any fan of this type of song, but from a guy whose pretty much heard it all, I've heard this one before, and done a whole lot better. However, I may be a sucker for the piano, but the musical work here is pretty good.

So overall, from the vocals to the lyrics, A-Z, 1, 2, 3, this song doesn't do anything for me, except put me to sleep. The whole song was probably written to appease a record exec who wanted something to sell, which isn't bad, except when you put no work into it. Unoriginal and Boring are not desirable qualities I like in my music, so if you're into that, this is for you. I'll just keep my distance.","and even show off their softer side . and sweet , sometimes darker and more haunting , and sometimes just plain amazing .

A2JAKHFYI88ZX0,B000006045,1,1,5,"This is one of my favorite trip hop albums. The first four tracks are just amazing, and have me repeating them over and over. The songs respectively are  ""Angel,"" ""Risingson,"" ""Teardrop,"" and ""Inertia Creeps"". ""Angel"" has a stark production featuring pointed beats and a distorted bassline that frames the vocal and a two-minute flame-out with raging guitars. ""Risingson"" is a dense, dark sounding song with a ton of dub throughout. ""Teardrop"" is an awesome song where they collabored with Elizabeth Fraser from Cocteau Twins. ""Inertia Creeps"" is a highlight with an atmospheric sound, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen. These songs are definately the highlight, and the other songs are still good, just not as good as these four in my opinion. Overall an awesome album that should have a place in every music collection.","This is one of my favorite trip hop albums .

A37VF0LNXK0IA6,B00DY9A8NI,1,-1,3,"This is a decent mp3 set of various works by Tchaikovsky, heavy on works for orchestra. The best parts here are the less frequently heard works, such as the Orchestral Suites 2 & 4, the Piano Trio in A minor, The Seasons, the Danish Festival Overture and others. The version of the Manfred Symphony is really good, and it has been for a long time one of my favorite lesser known Tchaikovsky works. However, on the down side, the more familiar pieces in this set just do not seem to be very good performances. The numbered symphonies all sound bland and lifeless.(BTW-where is the Symphony No. 3, the Polish? You can't put in every symphony, including the Manfred, and leave out one of the earlier ones.) The piano and violin concertos also sound barely decent. The ballets are a strange mixture. You get the complete Nutcracker, (though split up over several tracks in a very frustrating way) seven or eight pieces from Swan Lake, and a single excerpt from Sleeping Beauty. What's up with that? The suite from each one would have sufficed, if that's how they were going to do it. The chamber pieces were decent, though it would have been nice to see the sextet version of Souvenier de Florence instead of the string orchestra version. And the piano pieces were barely noticed.
  Overall, if you are a newbie to Tchaikovsky and aren't too picky on the quality of the performances, you might want to try this out. At 99 cents it's not terrible. But if not, then just cherry pick this set for the Manfred and the Orchestral Suites. Plus the Piano Trio. -------------PEACE","This is a decent mp3 set of various works by Tchaikovsky , heavy on works for orchestra .

That alone makes it worth hearing a few hundred times but my, oh my- -those songs.  I don't know what the rift was over the band's direction that temporarily broke them up (a family affair, you see), but whatever it was the Brothers rose above the occasion and created one of the finest records of the glorious, inglorious Sixties.  It was their last of that decade, and everything they'd done previous to it, great as it may have been, was merely prelude.  In England ODESSA was released as a red-velvet two-LP box set; in the States as a red-velvet double LP with a remarkably green disaster-at-sea insert.  You could put the thing on your coffee table (or floor, or kitchen counter) and let it speak for itself, or you could lie back and immerse yourself in its velvety sonic ocean.  Or both, with or without headphones.  Okay, that may be overstating it, but ODESSA contains some of the Brothers' finest compositions, ranging from the story-telling prog-rock of the title track (the cello solo is an ingenious touch) to the lighter-than-air, lovely 'Melody Fair' to the oboe-chugged, acoustic 'Suddenly' (Maurice was always the underappreciated contributor) to the desperately haunted 'Sound Of Love'.  Heck, they even included an international anthem that actually sounds like one, the prescient globalists!!  And two other orchestral instrumentals to boot!  And- -'Lamplight'!! You want goofy instead?  Okay, 'Give Your Best', and 'Never Say Never Again'! There! These guys are awesome!  Now, stop me before I start raving about how incredible CUCUMBER CASTLE is!!","This is still the lushest of all the Bee Gees ' albums , unless you count the late , great CUCUMBER CASTLE .

A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"It is a myth that soul was a singles medium. At least half a myth. In the 1960s, it was True. Most Motown albums were not meant to hold together as such. But when Stevie Wonder released Music Of My Mind in early 1972, he proved soul LPs could work as cohesively as any rock LP.

And so it went for Gamble and Huff and Thom Bell, the Philly Sound. Both the O'Jays with Back Stabbers and here, this first Spinners album, are just that: albums. Playing the singles on AM was AM's gain and lack of FM airplay was FMs loss.

The Spinners, the album, does not have a concept like the O'Jays Back Stabbers or Ship Ahoy.  Or does it? If love and passion can be a concept, it is best illustrated on this album

There is the Philly Sound, there is........well, easy there, let's climb one mountain at a time.  The lush horns, strings, vibes, and master vocals are wound into one massive, wonderful silk sheet of sound. I don't have to tell you, just listen. Wagner would be proud

""I'll Be Around,"" ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love,"" ""One Of A Kind Love Affair."" Anyone born by 1970 or before grew up hearing these on the radio, and do you believe how stupid some of us were? We heard this music next to Daddy Dewdrop's ""Chick-A-Boom,"" or ""Have You Ever Been Mellow,"" by Oliva Newton John, and quickly ran to our King Crimson albums, unable to separate the prime rib from the beef jerky. The best soul from the worst pop. We look at ourselves now. Wagner would NOT approve.

More proof. Yeah, sure. Play part of Coltrane's Love Supreme next to Bobby Goldsboro's ""Honey,"" and run for the hills. The blimp has crashed. But take said 'Trane and then go into ""One Of A Kind Love Affair,"" and it will be the start of a one of a kind love affair--for you. Me too.

Talking jazz,  I almost forgot. There is jazz here, too. Check out the third track, ""Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You"" I needn't go into this, but it proves my point. All this wonderful music is wonderful music, some of which happened to be singles. But listen to The Spinners from start to end, like a stranger to this music, and all the richness and craft and variation, and there is a ton, holds together musically and conceptually.

I recently have bought a ticket for their upcoming fall tour so in preparation I picked up a copy of the band's last studio album (when Michael Steele was still in the band) Doll Revolution (the band's first album since Everything). I used to have the cd years ago but had to sell it for some much needed cash. I am so glad I bought it again. I almost forgot how much I loved the album. I definitely can hear the maturity in the band's songwriting. Like in the '80s, the women all harmonize perfectly together as well as take turns singing lead. I enjoyed all the songs. The bonus dvd is a nice treat for fans of the band. Overall I felt like I got my money's worth.

AB6O8EM172B74,B000W1QVYG,1,1,5,"As a guy who has been hurt by women (as we all have been!) - this song turns out to be a terrific release of some of the frustration and anger which a man may feel as a result of having been hurt, dumped, or somehow otherwise 'offended' by a member of the 'fairer' sex.

The lead singer, a man called Graham Bonnet, does an awesome job of getting the message, and 'feeling,' behind the Title (and lyrics) out to the listener.

The video inspired me to purchase this song, and, although my mood is not always angry, spiteful, or vengeful - I am usually able, upon 'demand,' to 'conjure up' the proper memories and female related pain and torment to completely, and thoroughly, enjoy this classic British rock song from the late 1970's!

You can't literally give 110% in anything that you do - the numbers will simply not allow it.  But (and you need to watch the video to fully understand appreciate where I am coming from here) in this case, with this song, and in this video, 110% is, in fact, given.

The language in this song is vulgar (lots of f-bombs).  It's definitely not for the kids or people offended by foul language!

The music from Watsky is very good.  The melody, beat and lyrics are all good, but the language is vulgar.  The message, about a couple accepting each other as they are, baggage and all, is great.  In fact, he sings that he prefers a woman with a past because it makes her more interesting and fun to be around.

The sexual connotation of the title, however, just seemed to be pushing artistic license too far without adequate justification. For that, I've deducted a star.

I'm glad I was able to pick this song up for free, because I wouldn't have checked it out, otherwise.  Hum... I wonder what the radio version is like.  Bring it on!","Warning - Not for the Kids !

With NUMEROUS pushbacks in the late 2012 you would think it was to make the product much better. But that didn't seem to be the case here. It's not anything but the lyrics that seems to be the problem here. If you wanna know how much money Wiz has and how much weed he smokes, just listen to this album. He makes more than an obvious point here in about 90% of the songs.

O.N.I.F.C. (Only N**** In First Class/One Night In First Class) is the worst of all. And one would expect this to be good after the mixtape Taylor Allerdice, which was good as well.

Production heren is good. You can tell that Wiz picked the beats that have the nice long vibing sounds, which is heard all over this album. The best songs on here are the ones he colabs with other artists. ""Let It Go"" has Akon singing the chorus around Wiz' braggadocious lyrics. ""The Bluff"" has Cam'ron spitting a good verse. Even 2 Chainz sounds refreshing on ""Its Nothin"". And his Taylor Gang crew members sound better than him on ""The Plan"" and ""Medicated"". The single ""Remember You"" with The Weeknd sounds good, but having Abel lead off the song and sing the chorus and has Wiz rhyme about something totally different makes the song almost a waste. There are a small number of solo songs that Wiz has that he can hold his own, but don't expect much from those.

O.N.I.F.C. had the potential to be a good album. I for one is very dissapointed after all the pushbacks and delays, this is the best we as fans can get.

Something that only few and far between artists whom has passed on can still deliver in spirit. His last major hit, You Rock My World from his lackluster Invincible record still remains very solid with his standard dance songs from the late 70's and 80's. It is one of his better songs from Invincible that still stands tall. While it isn't as good as his ballads were like Man In The Mirror or Lady In My Life. Still, it holds up well into why he will always be The King Of Pop. He knew what he wanted in song and heart. The song still stands taller than most of the junk on radio today.

It often automatically presumed that because a recording has been re-mastered, or transferred from analog to digital, that it's better.  Not so in many cases.  Re-mastering often over-compresses the original recording and results in the equivalent of a poor mix.  Subtleties in the background either disappear, or become so faint as to lose relevance to the song.

In the two Robert Plant songs that I downloaded ('Big Log' and 'In The Mood'), I found this to be the case.  Extremely disappointing.

A3C6ZCBUNXUT7V,B0011YBRFQ,1,1,4,"AZ, one of the realest and one of the best ever behind the mic, is back after slightly over 3 years since his last LP to bring you the appropriately titled ""A.W.O.L."" - his 5th solo release (not counting his ""S.O.S.A."" EP that was shelved in 2000 and his ""Final Call"" album that was supposed to come out in June 2004 but kept getting pushed back & bootlegged and eventually was shelved as well). How it rates to his other albums, probably right in the middle, not his worst (which I'd still say is a strong 4 star album) and not the best.  Packed with 15 songs (track 13 is 3 songs off his ""Final Call"" album), it has 1 classic, 9 songs are good and the other 5 are ok. Guests rap on 3 songs and do hook on 2 others so you get enough of AZ to satisfy your thirst after a long AZ drought. Production is only about average (other then on a few tracks) which brings the album down a little (it's never his lyrics or flow which are both top notch and A game). Heatmakerz, and Baby Paul each do 2 songs, Disco D, Emile, Frado, Vinny Idol, Fizzy Womack of M.O.P., DJ Absolut, Tone Mason, J Hen, DJ Premier, MoSS, and Buckwild all do 1 song. A great album to have for his fans and fans of True hip-hop.

Anthony Cruz --- Brownsville, Brooklyn, NY -- b. around 1972","and one of the best ever behind the mic , is back after slightly over 3 years since his last LP to bring you the appropriately titled "" A.W.O.L. "" - his 5th solo release ( not counting his "" S.O.S.A. "" EP and eventually was shelved as well ) . How it rates to his other albums , probably right in the middle , not his worst ( which I would still say is a strong 4 star album ) and not the best . Packed with 15 songs ( track 13 is 3 songs off his "" Final Call "" album ) , it has 1 classic , 9 songs are good and the other 5 are ok . and do hook on 2 others so you get enough of AZ to satisfy your thirst after a long AZ drought . which are both top notch and Baby Paul each do 2 songs , Disco D , Emile , Frado , Vinny Idol , Fizzy Womack of M.O.P. , DJ Absolut , Tone Mason , J Hen , DJ Premier , MoSS , A great album to have for his fans and fans of True hip - hop . # 2 - 10 ( CLASSIC -- great beat ) # 5 - 6.5 ( f/ Noe - not a good beat ) # 6 - 8 ( old school type song - beat is not the best # 11 - 7 ( f/ Bounty Killer ) # 13 ( 2nd song ) - 9 ( f/ CL Smooth )"

As personalities in a fog, we always sense an iceberg approaching at ramming speed. The key for me is she thinks crossing her legs is funny. This song works with a man and a woman singing about each other. The combination is a big door prize. There are ups and downs:

He ain't been laid in a month of Sundays.
I caught him once and he was sniffing my undies.

Intellectual involution is only aroused when magic makes whatever comes next far more interesting than what we have observed so far. The secrets that work for circus stunts, religion, philosophy, and the usual cosmic pogo stick ups keep our scrambled eggs all runny.","who work are expected to take part in the kind of mechanism without magic that avoids anything The key for me is she thinks crossing her legs is funny .

A5SC9O8TZJ6DK,B00906I2K0,1,1,4,"Like so many, I had a feverish reaction to Chan ""Cat Power"" Marshall's breakthrough opus, 1998's Moon Pix. In those days Marshall could only sort of play guitar and kind of sing, yet she undeniably knew how to make a unique album. In the years since, Marshall has become a competent - and even creative - guitarist, a very good songwriter and, most considerably, one of the hardest working and distinct vocalists of her time. That voice, it soars.

Marshall's last album-full of originals, 2006's The Greatest, pushed the artist to another level. No longer was she the shy indie rock pixie with boyish good looks and artsy singer/songwriter fare; she was now a tall, model-esque soul singer with a big, full-sounding soul album that thousands of people were suddenly buying with their coffee and paper towels at the Target cash wrap. Sun, Cat Power's seventh album of originals (and ninth overall), takes a step back from the big box checkout line, offering up Marshall's most artsy batch of tunage since the beloved Moon Pix.

Despite not having the clearest, most approachable sound, I think Sun is most definitely an accessible, confident even poppy record. Its language isn't nearly as universal as the soul sound of The Greatest, and the song structures and arrangements aren't as avant-garde as Moon Pix or the the two records that came before it. We hear drum machines contrasted against gritty licks, the focus always on Marshall's voice, which is more subtle, layered and nuanced than on recent records. Where The Greatest was bombastic in its straight-forward style, Sun is a minimalist exercise in labored detail, the Cat having clearly spent much time hunched over the keyboards and samplers that ornament her basic tracks. The result is a stylistically challenging listen that, while more instantly accessible than it sounds, rewards familiarity with the kind of tasteful, timeless, hip detail Marshall has long been known for.

""3,6,9,"" one of the three (Or is it six? Or is it nine?) tracks that first helped me to understand this anew Cat, feels, at first, like a modern-era pop mess.  Marshall includes so many production details - including bits of auto-tune - into what is otherwise a straightforward pop song that reminds me, in sprit at least, of Marah's Float Away with the Friday Night Gods, a very hated, highly misunderstood attempt at big pop appeal. A few listens later and my aesthetic impression moved from Float Away to U2's Pop, a similarly modern and gutsy stab at high-production pop rock. Fun, strange, challenging rides, both.

Why release an artsy, challenging, possibly off-putting pop record after achieving breakthrough status with a loyal genre record like The Greatest? Because, as noted above, Marshall is nothing if not an album-maker. A Bowie-inspired creative spirit who prefers the thrill of creative challenge to the comfort of strategic art. We hear that spirit, that freedom, on every track. The biggest achievement here is how Marshall has managed to form her sprawling ideas about modern pop - and classical songwriter style - in a cohesive piece.

It's anybody's guess what the legacy of Sun will be. My assumption is that, despite being maybe her most catchy batch of tunes, the record will endure as a deep catalog treasure amongst Cat Power enthusiasts. A side note favorite, loved for its strong personality and creative bravery. To me, Sun is not just one of the year's most interesting and accomplished listens, but also the second best Cat Power disc yet, stuck only behind 2003's tremendous You Are Free. (88/100)

A3JUMMIGJ7B38X,B008WHQZJI,1,1,5,"Pet Shop Boys' last album, Yes, was rather lackluster.  It had some good moments, but overall it seemed a bit flat.  Before that, Fundamental was pretty good yet still failed to live up to the truly great albums like Very, Behaviour, or even Release.  So it was with a cautious ear that I listened to their latest offering, Elysium.  I am pleased to report that this album redeems all past mistakes.  PSB has crafted a truly blissful offering filled with intelligent and mature electropop.

The most striking aspect of Elysium that most people will notice is that the album isn't a four-on-the-floor dance record.  It's not Nightlife.  In fact, it's closer to a combination of Behaviour and Release.  It's got pop ballads and mid-tempo gems, but nothing for clubs.  This isn't a bad thing...as PSB seems to really nail it when they go this route.  I read some of the other reviews and it seems many were disappointed because they were expecting something more upbeat.  But if one listens without expectations, they will be pleasantly surprised.  There isn't a single track on this album that I want to skip, which is nice as the last album was so sketchy.

The best tracks on here are definitely ""Leaving"", which has some really chic arrangement, ""Invisible"" is melodic and heartfelt, ""Breathing Space"" is like a more accessible version of Release's ""Birthday Boy"", ""Ego Music"" is erratic and experimental, reminiscent of something you'd hear from the French duo Air, but still works wonderfully here.  In fact, starting with ""Ego Music"" the album delves into full concept album mode.  Mixing broadway-style numbers like ""Hold On"" with the gloriously dark and abstract ""Everything Means Something"".  Truly mesmerizing stuff!

This is truly the Pet Shop Boys' most beautiful and lush album to date.  I truly hope the people giving it negative reviews will click to this album.  It truly cannot be missed.","Pet Shop Boys ' last album , Yes , was rather lackluster .

A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO,B00JQHPJLS,1,1,5,"This was perhaps Jena's crowning achievement on American Idol and IMHO showed that she was not only a talented singer but a creative artist.  It's a challenge for the contestants to sing covers yet show some uniqueness.  She certainly did that here--I've heard the original but didn't purchase it.  I don't think it was done anywhere near as well as Jena did it--whether one likes the slowed down version or not, her voice quality was far better than Radiohead's.  Unfortunately, at the end of the competition, American Idol (as in most viewer voted game shows) becomes more a contest between/among the voters rather than between/among the performers.  IMHO Jena outshined all the other contestants due to her creative style, uniqueness, and voice quality--though Caleb shined in stage presence.  A lot depends on the weights a voter has on the various aspects of performances--and how easily/early voters commit to a particular performer--ignoring later differences at times.  I only bought one song this season of American Idol, and this is the song.","This was perhaps Jena 's crowning achievement on American Idol that she was not only a talented singer but a creative artist . It is a challenge for the contestants to sing covers She certainly did that here -- I have heard the original I do not think it was done anywhere near as well as Jena did it -- whether one likes the slowed down version or not , her voice quality was far better than Radiohead 's .

His recording career has focused almost solely on the electric side of his playing, but as he has shown at many festivals and on his Live at Bonaroo album, Haynes is no slouch with the acoustic guitar. The batch of songs he put together for his latest recording, Ashes and Dust, are more in the ""singer/songwriter"" vein than the ""crank up the Les Paul"" vein, and Haynes finds himself right at home telling stories accompanied by an acoustic guitar. One of the complaints I always had with Haynes' solo acoustic work was that, even though it was well done, it sounded as though there was something missing. That ""something"" it turns out was a group of equally talented musicians to accompany him. For the job of accompanying Haynes on Ashes and Dust, he chose Railroad Earth and the results are second to none. Railroad Earth are every bit as talented on their respective instruments as Haynes is on the guitar, and the results of the collaboration are as warm and inviting as anything that has come before. The songs are beautiful, the playing is top notch, and I have no doubt Ashes and Dust will bring Haynes and Co. numerous accolades. Highly recommended.","Whether he is fronting Gov't Mule , playing with the Allman Brothers or the Dead , that he has ability to enter almost any musical situation and create something wonderful .

A14W1VNMMYLWND,B00122DEFI,1,1,5,"Major Harris releases his debut album My Way in 1974-75.  He has a cool vibin' voice and flows easy over the melody: no wonder why the Delfonics had him join them in the early 70's after Randy Cain (R.I.P.) left.  Here, he gets some solo shine and makes a wonderful record with different tempos and styles.  The hit single: ""Love Won't Let Me Wait""  is a cool-vibin, jazzy, classy number, with some orgasmic girl moans at the end of the slow drag.  ""Sideshow"" is a mellow cover of a Blue Magic classic jam, and Major Harris handles it well.  Other slower jams include ""Just a Thing I Do"" and ""My Way.""  The other songs are more up-tempo and also are spirit and soul up-lifters.  ""Sweet Tomorrow"" is gorgeous, poetic, and romantic.  The swinging vibe of ""Loving You Is Mellow"" with the heavenly chorus chants is another mood lifter.  All the songs on My Way are great: Major Harris has a great voice.

For newcomer Jhene Aiko, she has a lot to prove in her voice and the drive of a really good haunting song. Her debut single, The Worst is more haunting than delivering from her voice and the drive from the song. I really didn't find the song to be as haunting from the rhythm as maybe a song could be in the same way as was when others have tried to do that same kind of song. I really didn't find the song to be as striking as other songs have before.

A15105Y7IL1FO9,B01BWA7HDO,1,1,5,"Before Adele. Before Andra Day. Before Alessia Cara. There was Corinne Bailey Rae. Her angelic voice is strong but soft, sentimental without being overemotional.  Her first album was a walk through the grass, barefoot on a sunny day. Her follow up, was dark like waiting for a storm to pass. It took six years to put together her third album, The Heart Speaks in Whispers, which for CBR fans feels like a lifetime.

Last we saw Corinne, she was washing her pain away in the sea. She had just lost her husband and her life had hit a standstill. Now, she has recovered and is happy as evident throughout The Heart Speaks in Whispers. She is clearly in love again with heartfelt songs like Horse Print Dress, Been to the Moon and Green Aphrodisiac. She opens up on Hey, I Wont Break Your Heart. The ballads, Do You Ever Think of Me? and Night have lyrics like a young Stevie Wonder. The deluxe edition has four more songs including the sultry In The Dark, the best ballad of the album High, the disappointing Ice Cream Colours, and the standout Push On For the Dream.

It is good to see CBR happy again. Its easy to forget about Corinne Bailey Rae being that she only puts out albums once every 4-5 years. Such an absence could have been a risk to her career, and maybe it did hold her back from superstardom after such a hot start; however Corrine is an artist who is fueled by emotion. She does not waste time with metaphorical tales of hypothetical situations. Whatever she is feeling at the time, whether happy, sad or angry, that is what she brings to each album. Sometimes such emotions take time to express. Core fans can appreciate this because she continues to put out consistent, quality work. While she may not gain new fans with The Heart Speaks in Whispers, Corinne Bailey Rae continues to build an extraordinary body of work as the most underrated, underappreciated, and undervalued artists of the past decade.

A18OBUSMXVE8R0,B000WCYFH0,1,1,5,"I'm writing this review on the original Vinyl version of this album released by Columbia Records (CL 657) in 1955. The songs,music and sound are all excellent.
 In a collection such as this there are great variations. The songs are almost impossible to pin down as to dates,and there are instances where one set of lyrics may have several melodies,or where a melody may have any number of different lyrics.""Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie"",for example,is one of these. The basics has been traced to South Dakota in the early 1900's,but the song spread from there throughout the west.,and had many tunes and lyrics. ""The Old Chisolm Trail"" has many variations. This was the trail that extended from Texas to Kansas,where cowboys drove the herds of cattle to market. These hard of the trail working cowboys all knew there were wild times in the end that made up for the drudgery they went through on the trail. The beautiful ""Streets of Larado"",also known as ""The Cowboy's Lament"" was sung throughout the American and Canadian west. It is believed this song is of Irish origin,and has many different tunes and lyrics.
 The song ""Home on the Range "" is one of the best kpown and loved songs of the west.
 All the songs included make this one of the best collections one can find that represent the best songs that were so much of the west,and even after the days when they were sung at campsites along the trail;they became an intregal part of all western movies.
 For a list of all the songs check out  and even sample the MP3 version. There are several Reviewers who feel the re mastered versions are not as good as they hoped for. My original vinyl album has a cover showing cowboys alongside the herd. There are two very similar photographs shown here.with a cowboy in the forground. One has the rider facing the herd,in mine that same rider is facing leftward..

-Food
-Soul & Substance
-What You See
-R U Listening?

These songs are hot. Pay $4 to download these, and put the other $5 toward the full Czarface album. Or use them to download DTD, It's What It Is, ENY House, and East MC's from his other albums.

As an album, I think it's MK's weakest. I have no problem w/ the fact that he's pursuing a different sound and doesn't have any Wu features. I think MK can stand on his own two feet, and I like his style. He really shines on those 4 tracks I mentioned.

The problem is that there are only a couple other actual songs, and those didn't do much for me, and once you subtract a couple of skit-type tracks and a few forgettable spoken word tracks, there's really not enough on here to justify calling it an album. Compare to the number of actual songs (i.e., with rap verses) on, say, Wu-Block or, again, Czarface.

I'm saying, if Killa's gonna call this an album and expect my $10 (which he got), he needs to deliver at least 10-15 actual rap songs.","There are some really solid tracks on this album .

ADS5APY1NKTL4,B00137G8OG,1,1,5,"If anyone is looking for an introduction to Marvin Gaye at one of his finest hours, vocally, ""Sexual Healing"" is a prime example. For starters, that hypnotic ""Get Up, Get Up, Get Up, Get Up"" hook that is softly whispered over the rhythmic beat calls us into the theme of the track. Marvin's voice is like that of an ecstatic angel living with one foot in the clouds and another in the entrance way to the bedroom. I can picture hips gyrating, beautiful women dancing in the background, red satin sheets, candles, rose petals and the whole bit.

In all my years of listening to music, never have I heard a song quite so stirring and smooth. Marvin states in no uncertain times that he is seeking some sexual healing from his partner (or partners) and is not shy about laying his cards right out there throughout the duration of the song. The song starts beautifully and truly ends too quickly.","If anyone is looking for an introduction to Marvin Gaye at one of his finest hours , vocally , "" Sexual Healing "" is a prime example .

A1EG1SW4UA7RS4,B00AOMSQPU,1,1,5,"I'll admit I didn't really jump on board when this album was released last year.  It's definitely a contender for Rapzilla.com's Album of the Year for 2013.  After my first listen I was amazed. He didn't copy the similar formula that many hip-hop artists have used since his emergence.  Talented Xth brings a unique articulation of content which is severely needed in the genre.  He doesn't pull any punches or mince his words, as described in the song Jim Crow.  Sho definitely brought his A-game his flow and wordplay is first rate.  I'm glad he didn't use auto-tune and 808 heavy tracks.  Stated plainly songs like Jim Crow sadly won't make the Top 5, or BET countdown but should.  It's content isn't as deplorable as some have suggested.  Personally, I would equate it, with watching the Roots saga.  You are going to have your feathers ruffled but, for good reason.  Addressing racism, and hypocrisy even in the industry circle with which he had close ties with  without name dropping is a tall order.  But, Sho pulls its off. I believe that once you listen with the intention of gaining insight and not dismissing it as a ""diss record""  you will be pleasantly surprised.  I like how this album flows like a story book as opposed to a regular full length album with intros and outros.  Tracks like Michael, Exodus, Denzel,  Get Happy interlude, Me!, King,  Cliff and Claire display Sho and his featured guests creative flow and spiritual maturation. Ali is the motivational single that really lifts your spirit.  Hopefully, High Society and Hello Revolution will release another dope album.  Because the Lord has given Sho Baraka a gift that needs to be shared with the rest of the world.  I'm glad that he has taken the road less traveled even if it does get him ostracized.  Listen and listen well, go and be doers of the Word and not just hearers only.  Talented 10th gets the job accomplished.  Keep fighting and moving forward Sho!","I will admit I did not really jump on board It is definitely a contender for Rapzilla.com 's Album of the Year for 2013 . After my first listen I was amazed .

A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B00DE0NKRS,1,1,4,"I'd heard some good and great reviews of Toad's new release and I'm agreeing.  This is more than a solid from the Wet Sprocket boys.  It comes across as mature and self-assured.  They are not just making music but are crafting songs, moments of music and lyric that conveys a message and a mood.  Musically there's nothing too deep or adventurous here, but it is melodically solid and enjoyable.  Even the slower moments serve the sake of the song's mood and they seem to have tracked the album to break up the slower numbers (like ""Golden Age"") with peppier numbers (like the following ""Get What You Want"").  I hear a bit of a Joe Henry vibe on songs like ""The Moment"" and ""Golden Age"".  ""California Wasted"" has an almost alt-country Wallflowers flavor and opener ""New Constellation"" drops us into a lighthearted up tempo moment but, for my money, album closer ""Enough"" (about end of life decisions from someone dying from cancer I think) is the strongest overall track; smartly produced, a sad song that counterpoints the opener in its pathos, and yet completely sympathetic and conveying a feeling of strength it ends on an oddly triumphant note.  Now I mark this as pure emotion and am not necessarily agreeing (or disagreeing) with statements of belief that underpin this (or any of their) song(s) but I can tell you I really appreciate the thoughtful lyrics and that the songs are about different content and not just love pop fluff.  4.5 stars.

AKGF27HN0OF19,B000W11NQ2,1,1,4,"Buffett goes back to writing all of the songs on this album except one, and for the most part it works well.  After dabbling with country on the ""Riddles In The Sand"" album, Buffett moves back away from it with the exception of two tracks on ""Mango"".  ""Please Bypass This Heart"" is nothing spectacular, but the other country oriented tune on the album turns out to be one of it's best with ""If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me"".  I believe it has been covered by several country artists over the years and is a really great song (this is coming from a guy who does not like country music).  Other highlights on the album include ""Frank And Lola"" a hilarious character study of a middle age couple trying to re-kindle a spark in their relationship on vacation in Florida.  ""Desperation Samba"" is another great Buffett ""south of the border"" tune.  The title track ""Last Mango In Paris"" is classic Buffett.  The album closer ""Beyond The End"" is a song a lot of Buffett fans don't seem to care for, but I think it makes a nice grandiose close to the disc.  The album also includes several of Buffett's popular concert favorites ""Jolly Mon"" and ""Gypsies In The Palace"".  Some of the production on this album is very 80's oriented which dates it a bit, but overall this is another good album from Jimmy.","and for the most part it works well .

A32T2H8150OJLU,B004AXOBCG,1,1,5,"This is a great collection for the casual Billy Joel fan, which I am.

I was introduced to Billy Joel back in the late 1970s and I have had some of BJ's music in my collections on and off for the past 30+ years.  Of course no compilation from a catalog as large as BJ's will meet everyone's personal preferences, but this is a great cross-section and contains many of his best tracks. With that being said, any serious BJ fan will already have the majority if not all of these tracks, so this selection wasn't made for them.  It was made for people like me, casual fans who like to sing along when songs from the old days come on the radio, but who have not yet added any of his tracks to our digital collections.

As I scanned down this list of tracks I saw at least 14 tracks that I'm excited to add to my playlists, and maybe the other 5 tracks will grown on me, you never know.  Anyway, 14/19 is outstanding for any greatest hits album.  And since I snagged this during one of Amazon's $5 album sales that's a real bargain!  Thanks Amazon!

Well, whenever someone looks at a ""Hits"" album like this they say, why isn't _______ on it!?  I decided that what's on it's on it, and since it's got lots of what I like then, click, I bought it!  Personally I would have loved to see ""Honesty"" on it too, but sometimes life's like that.

Anyway, I'm excited to add these tracks to my list of MP3 titles and smile when they come up.","This is a great collection for the casual Billy Joel fan , Of course no compilation from a catalog as large as BJ 's will meet everyone is personal preferences , but this is a great cross - section and contains many of his best tracks . that being said , any serious BJ fan will already have the majority if not all of these tracks , so this selection was not made for them .

These are songs that seep under your skin and make the goosebumps rise when she takes your emotions like a new recruit and then sets sail on her musical waters riding the waves through storm and through calm.  The title track ""Sing the Delta"" is full of longing and the sweetest ache of times gone by, ""Sing the Delta a love song for me; Lay it down on that river; Let it roll on out to sea.""  The opening track ""Go On Ahead & Go Home"" has a joyous feel with the trill in Iris' vocals giving an extra emotional push, ""Go let your mama see you smile; Your mama's gonna wait however long it takes, but it's sure been awhile.""  When Iris' ""The Night I Learned How Not to Pray"" came on, I thought Iris was adapting Jeannie C. Riley's old tune ""Harper Valley PTA,"" but that impression soon faded as the lyrical darkness began to seep through.  The track is profound because all of us who have been through these deep personal trials must either lose faith or come to understand that our Heavenly Father is not our errand boy and is concerned more with the eternal than the temporal -- at least that's how it seems to me and what I get from this profound confessional song.

A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B0043X6AMW,-1,-1,2,"In the words of Elton John, ""karaoke albums don't count.""

Ever since he started recording these abysmal theme records nearly a decade ago, Rod Stewart has been more about surface appearance than sound. His album covers from this period make that evident. Unfortunately, donning a snazzy suit and singing chestnuts does not make one Tony Bennett any more than tossing on a leather jacket and ripped jeans makes one Joey Ramone or sporting a soulful swoon makes one Al Green.

In the world of Rod Stewart image is consistently at the forefront, especially on this disc, where he sounds in perpetual need of a throat lozenge. While his voice has coolly mellowed, not every show biz veteran emanates nostalgic gold on cue.

This music is as much about marketing and product-placement as the drivel being spilled out by acts such as Katy Perry or Ke$ha, with little to no soul, substance or artistry behind it. The only difference is the demographic being aimed at - here, baby boomers with only a minimal amount of sophistication or taste (if that) who know this material is ""good for them"" but do not have the energy, drive or impetus to locate performances of these songs from better, more suitable vocal interpreters. ""Rod Stewart"" is therefore more a brand and familiar face in this context.

The arrangements are textured and nicely orchestrated, and Stewart usually sounds like he is supplying differing emotions as he moves in and out of the tracks - and these are, after all, some of the best songs ever written. Even a minimum of competence as a singer can make the likes of ""What a Difference a Day Makes"" and ""I've Got the World on a String"" sound fine.

Stewart displays a minimum of enthusiasm for the material and his job as singer, so it all does sound ""fine"" - not transcendent, not brilliant, not particularly soulful, rich or stirring - in other words, not good enough.

In an era where we, by some wonderful luck, still have Tony Bennett regularly touring and hitting the backs of concert halls, unmiked, with his rendition of Bart Howard's ""Fly Me to the Moon,"" there is simply no need to hear Rod Stewart sleepwalk his way through it. It is redundant, reductive, excessive and unwholesome all at once, much like the experience of Michael Buble performing Sinatra bastardization in a predictable suit and tie. Mimicry is not art.

Go to the nearest jazz hole in the wall you can find if music really matters to you. Order a cocktail and sit down. You are guaranteed to have a more genuine experience than you would have playing this CD or seeing one of Mr. Stewart's overpriced concerts.

And if that's out of reach, try any album by Madeleine Peyroux.","Ever since he started recording these abysmal theme records nearly a decade ago , Rod Stewart has been more about surface appearance than sound .

I liked it instantly. As the song concluded Tom, said, ""that was the new single from Jennifer Holiday"" .  I almost instantly knew that it was Jennifer Hudson, he corrected himself by saying that because they were both associated with Dreamgirls he often confused their names.  Actually, it isn't that hard since both have the same first names.  According to Amazon, six people have reviewed the album and given it a solid five stars.  I guess they are privy to advance copies, it must be nice but I'm not hatin. I anticipate it will be as good as they say if the first single is any indication.  Much love to Miss Hudson for her first single and success on the album, which will undoubtedly be #1 Billboard R&B and likely Pop.","I liked it instantly . that was the new single from Jennifer Holiday "" .

A16CZRQL23NOIW,B0014KDRDC,1,1,5,"This transcendental CD show us just a minuscule evidence of the indomitable love of Casals for Schubert's music.

His singular predilection for this sublime work Op. 163; to my view, this is the greatest string quintet ever composed. Moreover, I have four different versions with  Casals.

I would say this is probably, the most intimate and serene of the four versions I have. The dream team was Isaac stern and Alexander Schneider first and second violins, Milton Katims viola and Casals and Tortellier first and second cellos respectively. It's to say half Budapest quartet (Katims and Schneider), Stern whose prodigious career was increasing and Paul Tortellier a True legend of the instrument.

All of them achieved a memorable musical feat through this hypnotic performance, whose penetrating lyricism and absorbing quietness carved in relief. The quality sound (keeping in mind it was recorded in 1952, was surprisingly good).

In which concerns Schubert's Fifth Symphony, this is the first release. Due multiple motives, this recording was found in the archives of Prades and this finding was fortunate. The approach given to the Mozartian First movement and the heavenly inspiration of the Second movement is unbelievable. In spite of being Kertesz' interpretation with the Vienna the most radiant and engaging that I know, this musical document from 1953, is an invaluable musical document, absolutely essential for all hard music lover.

A2OI8ONWP8JA1V,B0083WMA4Q,1,1,5,"Earth, Wind & Fire has certainly been IMO the platinum standard for musicianship and vocals!

Hearing this song by Eric Benet certainly brings to mind the EWF classic ""THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD"" ... one would almost swear he either sampled the entire rhythm track from that song or he went out and wholesale commissioned EWF to play on this tune! I had to check the CD's credits to make sure Philip Bailey wasn't listed as a background vocalist, because it sure sounds like him singing ""WEE-DOO-DOO-DOO"" on this track.

On his own merits Eric Benet is a stellar A-List R&B singer with a Falsetto range rivaling that of the great Philip Bailey of EWF. Indeed, Benet is a friend and colleague of Maurice White, Philip Bailey and the entire EWF family. If Philip Bailey ever decides to retire from EWF, Benet would fit in nicely as a replacement! He's certainly got the range and the vocal chops to do all the Philip Bailey-led Falsetto songs of the EWF playlist ... particularly ""REASONS""! Who else besides Eric Benet could even hope to do justice to that EWF gem? I sure would like to see Eric Benet & EWF on the same show/tour; no matter who opens for whom!

But I digress ...

On this single, Eric Benet does more than just copy or sample the EWF flavor, he takes their whole pot of stew and adds something uniquely all his own ... the recipe really cooks ... and it works!!

A1NS9WO1VACAUN,B00ILZ2OIM,1,1,5,"I know that is a strong statement but I stand by it.  I've been a mad fan since the moment his first single was released in the early 90's.  I can sing every song from the ""Supermodel of the World"" album by heart....""Do you think you are fierce??"" ""Tell the man with the money to come here and pay me..""

So here we are with ""Born Naked"" the latest from the Rupaul/Lucian Piane series.  The first thing you instantly notice when comparing this album to the previous Piane collabs, is refinement and quality.  This album has just gone through a massive upgrade in style and sound.

I don't necessarily like that the album opens with ""Freaky Money,"" but I look at it as a continuation almost.  This track sounds closest to that raw, unfinished quality the previous two Piane albums had so it almost makes sense to open with this as a gesture of closure and then to reveal the rest of the album which is polished and flawless.

The Dance-Floor ready bangerz are really exceptional:
Sissy That Walk - This really has potential to be the Supermodel of this era.  Stunning vocals, great beat and highly addictive.
Adrenaline - Another fresh aggressive beat meets great vocals from Ru and Myah.  Think electro banger in the vein of LMFAO.
Fly Tonight - Sounds like pure top 40 dance r&b.  Think last few singles from Usher, Taio Cruz, etc.
Modern Love - Vocoded with that rock dance Daft Punk sound from the 2000's.
Dance With You - This one was heavily highlighted on the Rupaul show and is extremely catchy/accessibly dance-pop.

Non-Dance Tracks
Let the Music Play - Cheesy lyrics but truly such an addictive track and just finely produced. LOVE this mid-tempo track.
Geronimo - Love this trap/twerk track with Ru rapping about bouncing your booty and Game of thrones and such. Werk!
Can I get an Amen - If Ru hasn't trademarked ""the term"" he sings across this track he should.  Love the return of his old duet partner Martha Wash.  Beautiful acoustic track.  Rupaul is crossing over beautifully into genres outside dance.
Born Naked - 80's pop rock and a rather unnecessary track on this album.

Aside from opener Freaky Money and closer Born Naked, this album is flawlessly executed, produced and delivered.  Bravo Rupaul!!  You just get better and better!","that is a strong statement I have been a mad fan since the moment his first single was released in the early 90 's . you think you are fierce ? ? "" and pay me ..

A1IIUCG9TJFUWS,B005A31ROK,-1,1,5,"""Yeah, well... there's the ultimate `production record,'"" was my first thought, upon first hearing this. (A ""production record,"" of course, is anything built ENTIRELY behind the board.) ANYBODY could have sung the vox, in other words... ANYBODY could have built the drum-track on any old laptop, ANYBODY could have built the bass line with a phlanger add-in to Reason -- and ANYBODY could have the mixed the whole thing with PT on any old PC in anybody's basement.

The truth is, however, that the track NOT a by-the-numbers piece from RedOne's assembly line - and that's a very cool thing indeed: it is, instead, a self-crafted little gem from a duo straight out of nowhere, Colorado. Yeah, it SOUNDS (initially) like a crunk-core version of any other production record; it has every hallmark of every other major-label McCookie McCutter record-of-the-moment (which will be history the very moment that THIS PARTICULAR SPLIT-SECOND passes the world by) - BUT THIS ONE HAS SOMETHING ELSE: this one has THAT EXACT AND SPECIFIC something else; that special, intoxicating, can't-quite-put-your-finger-on-it THANG that hits just the right mix of jarring yet cool and yet utterly NEW genre-mashing... that THANG which leads to monster hit records -- which, ultimately, turn-out to be so massive that they lead to the direct creation of entirely new sub-genres within modern pop.

It's THAT damn huge.

BLACKOUT is simply ALL KINDS of massive.

Breathe Carolina mix electronica with post-hardcore; they mix autotune with vocorder while screaming vox into the red. In other words, they break EVERY rule. ""Um, yeah... guys, that's not supposed to work."" It DOES, though: it works PERFECTLY. And that's the crux: they mix clean with unclean vocals AND EFFECTS; they mix all of those exact and specific things which AIN'T SUPPOSED TO WORK AT MASS MARKET ON THE BIG CHART AT ALL. They take EVERY musical risk, is what I'm trying to say; they take EVERY wrong turn and almost dare the song to fall apart, and, oh man... is it EVAR cool. I mean, it's just hella HELLA cool... it's just all kinds of goddang awesome. In other words, what they have here is something that every label on Earth is constantly searching for, and yet so rarely find: A sound that is blazingly unique, blindingly frigging original, and ooooohhh-sooooo-insanely-commercial. You can almost SMELL the platinum.

Blackout is a MONSTER. As I write this, the song has yet to chart, anywhere. I heard the track on middle-of-the-night Minnesota radio, and I could hardly imagine the jing this thing will pull, like a magnet, from iTunes. It IS, simply, the record of the year. I can't even count the possible ringtones in this thing; there's gotta be at least a hundred Million worth of ringtone$ in Blackout. It's the edgiest thing to hit the big chart (WHEN it hits, that is) in a good long while... the style is BRAZEN; the record is a textbook on FLAIR. It's just gripping, man... the band rips through its chorii like Bon Jovi on steroids. It's anthemic, and you just can't turn it off. Even after it ends, you find yourself turning-off the radio just to re-listen, in your head, to what you've just heard.

It's the Bay City Rollers doing Linkin Park covers -- as if they were produced by RedOne and mixed by Bob Rock.

Absolutely MASSIVE.

A1KYHC3ZXAJICU,B00I83XD14,1,1,5,"This release is from a show recorded on Friday December 12, 1969 at a place that was briefly called the Thelma which little is known about. It was located on the Sunset Strip near the Whiskey. I knew someone up until about 8 months ago who caught the band quite a few times between 1966 and 1972 in the area and he couldn't remember the place (hey Gary H. if you read this). This was the third show in a three night stand with Steve Stills showing up at the first show on the 10th. Various parts of these shows have shown up in trading circles for decades. Even odder is that while some of the songs on the audience versions match the soundboard versions, others do not.

As for this show itself, the first 45 minutes were missing from the vault for many years although a passable version turned up in trader's circles a few years back. The show opens with a grooving Cold, Rain and Snow and a rocking Me And My Uncle. Both Easy Wind and Next Time You See Me are taken at a slow pace with Pig and Jerry singing harmony on Next Time. There are great early versions of newer songs like Black Peter, Dire Wolf, High Time, Casey Jones and the newish combo of China Cat Sunflower>I Know You Rider mixed in with older songs like He Was A Friend Of Mine. The show is brought to a screeching finale with a massive jam of Alligator>Caution>Feedback>We Bid You Goodnight. If you were fortunate enough to get the bonus disc subscription, then you have massive versions of Dark Star>Saint Stephen>The Eleven>Cumberland Blues and That's It For The Other One>Cosmic Charlie. If you missed that, head over to a torrent site and download the circulating copy of that show!","Even odder is As for this show itself , the first 45 minutes were missing from the vault for many years The show opens with a grooving Cold , Rain Both Easy Wind and Next Time You See Me are taken at a slow pace with Pig and Jerry singing harmony on Next Time .

AV648VU7JR5D5,B00137QV7K,1,1,5,"Composed by Paul Simon, who said it came to him all of a sudden, Bridge Over Troubled Water is beautifully sung by Art Garfunkel. Larry Knechtel, a member of the Wrecking Crew, plays piano. It was inspired by a song from the gospel group the Swan Silvertones. It has been covered by such artists as Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Simon began working on it in the same house George Harrison sang about on the Beatles' Blue Jay Way.

It is a song of comfort and solidarity, it has a light in the darkness quality, no matter how low you feel I'm on your side. The piano gives it the feel of some sort of old hymn that has been around forever. Towards the end, the duo sing in harmony on the Sail on silver girl part, and the drums gain strength on see how they shine.  Angelic strings carry it away to the horizon. Supremely moving.","who said it came to him all of a sudden , Bridge Over Troubled Water is beautifully sung by Art Garfunkel . Larry Knechtel , a member of the Wrecking Crew , plays piano .

I personally think that this album is smooth and still in style by today's grade of music. I don't believe in any way that this album is distasteful. To really complete the album you must by the 4 mp3 singles that doesn't come with the album. Then, you will understand that he hasn't lost a step. There are only a few artists that I will actually support and he is in my top ten. Please remember before Robin Thicke there was Jon B!

And it was, after the usual modern rock chart-toppers they marched out one-by-one, this song is a refreshing change until... Radio drags it through the mud that is their airwaves 10 times a day. It was after a little while of that that I got more of a critical eye with the song as I came up with reasons to hate the song that was so overplayed by radio jocks. So first off, while the verses are good, the chorus, especially the last couple rounds of it in the last minute or so in the song, turns away from that, and falls flat, making it a flat love song at the end.

So overall, great verses, bad chorus. Maybe not the best of songs to win your lovers hand. But in any case, it's a good shake-up from the usual Nickelback.","When I first heard this song on the radio , I was like , ' Wow , And it was , after the usual modern rock chart - toppers they marched out one - by - one , this song is a refreshing change until ...

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00C10MMBW,-1,-1,3,"When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has honestly the most overexposed artist of the past decade. For female artists, it has mainly been about her and everyone else, can go to the shelter. Sadly, her music has also lost its shine in voice and heart. Her last album 4 was absolutely atrocious. She really didn't ignite a fire in the way she did with her earlier music. That was shown in each and every song from that album, and sadly the ballads have weighed down in soul. Best Thing I Never Had is definitely a blah song, not anything to absolutely rave about. She really didn't ignite a fire from her voice into the song, and instead it felt watered down in song, especially compared to the ballads she had in her career before like Halo and Listen. Maybe she needs to find her voice again, and it will be the best thing she never had.

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"I remember first hearing this quality tune Black Velvet by Alannah Myles around the time I was 9-10 years old.  The song was played on local radio and I remember the song being performed at a carnival that was being held near the city that I lived in at the time (I just wish that I could remember if it was Alannah Myles and her group or if the performance was by a tribute band). Anyhow, the vocals and the lyrics of the  song musically paint a story that would make for good tv episode viewing or a movie about a heartbreaker who is easy on the eyes or maybe not conventionally attractive but a charmer.  Either way a person has to be open-minded to listen to this gem of a song due to the fact that the song appears to be about a womanizer who is easy on the eyes, maybe even pleasant to be around (I.e. a charmer) yet hard on a persons heart romantically speaking. Im also keeping a record of this song as one of the multiple tunes I remember from my childhood.","The song was played on local radio that I lived in at the time ( I just wish that would make for good tv episode viewing or a movie about a heartbreaker who is easy on the eyes or maybe not conventionally attractive but a charmer .

After the years with Columbia, Ahmet Ertegun, Tom Dowd and Jerry Wexler first took Aretha down to Muscle Shoals and immediately the hits flew out of the south to invade the world. She was born to sing the blues mixed with gospel and even a little pure rock 'n roll.
In 1972, another triumph occurred when they took Aretha down to the New Temple Baptist Church in Los Angeles and let her acquaint her audience with her roots in the church.
You would have had to be a True heathen not to be moved, touched and inspired by this amazing album.
I knew some of the spirituals like ""Amazing Grace"", ""Mary Don't You Weep"" and ""Climbing Every Mountain"". But Aretha somehow made me realize that they were all ingrained in my soul though I never heard them in catholic services,","Well , just Almighty !

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B000OET0JY,1,1,5,"This is the third of four twofers released in Britain in the late nineties containing her three Columbia and five Warner albums. Here you will find her second and third Warner albums (Cage the songbird, from 1983, and Nobody wants to be alone, from 1984). I do not play these albums as often as most of Crystal's other music but I always enjoy hearing them. They are high quality albums featuring the type of pop-country music that was popular on American country radio at the time, helping to maintain Crystal's position as one of the most important female singers in country music at the time, though she did not maintain that position for much longer.

The title track of Cage the Songbird is a cover of a relatively obscure but wonderful Elton John song. Other great songs include The sound of goodbye, I don't wanna lose your love and Turning away as well as fine covers of Victim or a fool (Rodney Crowell) and Take me home (Tom Waits).

The second album here, Nobody wants to be alone, is similar in style and quality. It includes more great songs such as A long and lasting love, Tonight tonight, the title track, Coming to the dance and Touch and go.

If you are a fan of Crystal's music, you will love these albums. They may be hard to find now but are definitely worth the search.","and Nobody wants to be alone , from 1984 ) .

A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B00136RM4W,1,1,4,"Death discs were an important part of pop music in the 1950s and early 1960s. One of the most memorable was ""Tell Laura I Love Her"" in which a teenage driver had a fatal accident in the stock car race he had entered to win cash to buy a wedding ring. The tale was all the more effective for being sung in an angelic high tenor by Ray Peterson.

Ray Peterson was born in Denton, TX on April 23, 1935. As a young boy he contracted polio which required lengthy hospitalization. But while in the hospital he began to sing for the other patients and decided that is what he wanted to do with his life. In 1957 Ray Peterson moved to Los Angeles and signed a recording deal with RCA Victor. He had several modest hits and then in June of 1960 RCA released ""Tell Laura I Love Her"" written by Jeff Barry and Ben Raleigh. It would become a Top Ten hit.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","Death discs were an important part of pop music in the 1950s One of the most memorable was "" Tell Laura I Love Her "" in which a teenage driver had a fatal accident in the stock car race he had entered to win cash to buy a wedding ring .

Yet, he really has had some good songs that really spoke well the past several years like I'm Yours and Lucky with Colbie Calliat. His latest song I Won't Give Up from his 4th record Love Is A Four Letter Word actually is a very nice song, and shows that he has grown nicely with his music over the past several years. While he has had one misstep with Word Play, he at least is growing nicely within. I hope that Jason can follow it up with his next single well, and I think he will not give up on that.

A2TWT7ZPBBYZYF,B0042IQ7YO,1,1,5,"New life has been breathed into the art of contemporary instrumental guitar with the first solo album of original material from veteran guitarist and composer Shambhu, aka Neil Vineberg. (Shambhu has a long list of impressive credits, having performed with Narada Michael Walden, Carlos Santana, and Clarence Clemons and recorded with Whitney Houston.)

Sacred Love is one of the most beautiful and most impressive guitar albums I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. One of the photographs on the CD, of Shambhu smiling meekly with his hand over his heart, might lead listeners to think that they are about to hear a collection of ponderous instrumental musings typically associated with New Age music. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But this is not that album. (Incidentally, the photograph is appropriate in that it conveys the sense of the music coming from Shambhu's heart and making its way into those of listeners, which it does).

The CD is brimming with masterfully played, boundary-crossing tunes touching everything from New Age and fusion to world music and smooth jazz. In fact, several cuts are radio-friendly and would be right at home on commercial jazz stations.

Shambhu wrote most of the compositions, co-wrote two or three, and plays acoustic and electric guitars. He also plays electric sitar, which reinforces the exotic Indian sounds of several tracks. This Southeast Asian influence is also reflected in the guitarist's name, a Sanskrit word meaning ""source of happiness,"" which is an apt description of his music as well. Shambhu's guitar and composing skills are comparable to those of Andy Summers, Pat Metheny, Lee Ritenour, and Larry Carlton, as well as fellow independent newcomers such as Devin Rice and Erin Aas.

The rich, full sound of the CD is fleshed out by an amazing lineup of musicians, among them - to name just a very few - Tony Levin (John Lennon, Peter Gabriel, King Crimson, Andy Summers) on bass, Jeff Haynes (Pat Metheny) on percussion, Jeff Oster on flugelhorn, and Charlie Bisharat on violin, with enchanting wordless vocals provided by Claytoven Richardson and Noah Wilding. Album producer Will Ackerman of Windham Hill Records and Private Music fame also lends his guitar and piano talents separately to a couple of tracks.

Sacred Love is an album that will satisfy many musical palates, not just those of guitar music fans. Shambhu is an artist to keep a close eye on. Hopefully this is the first of many more wonderful new albums to emerge from his creative vision.","New life has been breathed into the art of contemporary instrumental guitar with the first solo album of original material from veteran guitarist ( Shambhu has a long list of impressive credits , having performed with Narada Michael Walden , Carlos Santana , Sacred Love is one of the most beautiful and most impressive guitar albums I have ever had the pleasure of listening to . One of the photographs on the CD , of Shambhu smiling meekly with his hand over his heart , might lead listeners to think that they are about to hear a collection of ponderous instrumental musings typically associated with New Age music . that there is anything wrong with ( Incidentally , the photograph is appropriate in The CD is brimming with masterfully played , boundary - crossing tunes touching everything from New Age and smooth jazz . In fact , several cuts are radio - friendly and would be right at home on commercial jazz stations . and plays acoustic He also plays electric sitar , This Southeast Asian influence is also reflected in the guitarist 's name , a Sanskrit word meaning "" source of happiness , "" which is an apt description of his music as well . and Larry Carlton , as well as fellow independent newcomers such as Devin Rice and Erin Aas . The rich , full sound of the CD is fleshed out by an amazing lineup of musicians , among them - to name just a very few - Tony Levin ( John Lennon , Peter Gabriel , King Crimson , Andy Summers ) on bass , Jeff Haynes ( Pat Metheny ) on percussion , Jeff Oster on flugelhorn , and Charlie Bisharat on violin , with enchanting wordless vocals provided by Claytoven Richardson and Private Music fame also lends his guitar and piano talents separately to a couple of tracks . Sacred Love is an album that will satisfy many musical palates , not just those of guitar music fans . Hopefully this is the first of many more wonderful new albums to emerge from his creative vision ."

A25I6X7JUC2JXB,B004CA2QRO,-1,-1,2,"I have uneven feelings about Jazmine Sullivan's sophomore effort, Love Me Back.
The current standard of laptop-style production sounds cheesey  when paired with Sullivan's superior vocal ability. A live studio recording session with real musicians seems more suited for  her misguided and under-used talents. Just on the heels of her 2009 CD Fearless, this release is a rushed ill-conceived effort. It pales in comparison to her CD debut. I think more time should have been devoted in the development of this project.
The two single releases off this project, the Grammy nominated, ""Going In Circles"" and ""10
Seconds"" are the best  tracks. I also favor ""Redemption"" for its' vocal arrangement and storytelling elements. It should be considered as third single release.  But, Sullivan's duet with the popular Ne-Yo is likely to be the third single to garner heavy rotation radio airplay. That song really gets on ""my damn nerves, damn nerves""!
Too often today's music results in good voice presented with bad material. I hope Sullivan's future
projects will be more creative with time invested. This incomplete and rushed sophomore CD could've been great.

The guys continue to bring out high quality music while reinventing themselves.  Dark is the Way...has that familiar Anberlin sound (loads of energy and intensity).  But at the same time it feels different from any previous Anberlin cd.

I don't do the comparing a new album to previous efforts.  As they are an evolution in an artist or band's career.  It may only have 10 songs on this cd.  But all of those songs could be on any major radio station and do damage.

Dark Is the Way: Light Is A Place is an excellent 5th full-length effort by Anberlin and one that should only serve to tell what most fans already know.

After I'd seen that whole show, I got a little interested in the song, and looked it up. Even though I loved the show, I can tell you that Jonathan Coulton's song has now become the much more important to me.

I love it for a couple of reasons. First, it is a tremendously catchy song. It's well played and sung, with a great pop-rock chorus.

Second, it's actually sort of a meaningful song, at least to me. I'm not literally a code monkey, but there's not doubt that I'm a nerd, the proverbial nice-guy who comes in last and can't get the pretty receptionist to pay any attention to me, who works hard in a job that's boring and unappreciated.

ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B014C4H7PK,1,1,4,"How do you describe this band to folks who have never seen them? Let's see, they write and sing songs in sing songs in French, Italian, Spanish and English. They sound like 50s cocktail music sometimes and like 90s jazz sometimes. The two lead members both went to Harvard and the composer/pianist is a musical genius. And they come from, of all places, Portland, Oregon!

The only way to really explain them is to play a few tracks from their CDs.. or better yet... see them LIVE in concert (nearly all of which seem to sell out!).

This is their fourth album and the word continues to spread. I was anxiously awaiting this disc and am not disappointed! (Well, maybe because of two tracks .... more on that in a minute). All the elements of their previous albums are there from the multi-lingual songs crafted by either lead singer China Forbes or collaborator Alex Marashian (who is responsible for 5 of the 13 songs here) to the great arrangements by co-leader Thomas Lauderdale. Though a couple of songs are sung in languages other than English (the translations are included in the booklet included.).

I really hated to drop my rating to a 4 but there are two tracks that seemed out of place. It was great that they got the staff in their office to join in on the track ""Sing"" (the Sesame Street/Carpenters song), but the song is so saccharine that even PM can't make it palatable on repeated listening. The other track that doesn't work as well is ""Piensa en m"", where 90 year old Mexican singer Chavela Vargas (artist Frida Kahlo's lover) provides the vocals. Her aged voice is a far cry from the dulcet tones of China Forbes and the musical flow stops when she follows the ""Sing: track. All is well, though when the lyrically brief (just two verses) ""New Amsterdam"" closes out the disc, before a reprise of the lead off ""Ninna nanna"".

Though not my favorite PM CD, its heads above much of the other music out there. Pink Martini fans will definitely want this disc (while waiting anxiously for the next), and it's a good intro to those yet to discover the ""musical magic"" of the band.

But his latest song does take him back on solid ground. Thinking Out Loud, the third single from the X album does work better with his simplicity and natural beauty. The song definitely is a much better song than what he had lately came out with. He has the makings in the world of a young John Mayer in his voice and his heart. The song is a better download than his past few songs were. Hopefully, there will be more joy and natural beauty with his work soon.

I wouldn't say I was ever a fanatic PF fan, but I still vividly remember riding my bike home as a young teen with the newly released Dark Side of the Moon clutched under my arm, and their music and songs have been formative to a whole generation or two now.

This is a mature, mostly instrumental album that flows seamlessly and is the perfect culmination to this journey - and overall is a fitting tribute, with beautiful deluxe packaging in a sturdy box with quality photo cards and book.

Scottish identical twins, Charlie and Craig Reid -- these two brothers harmonize and sing off of each other well. Though only a modest hit in America, hitting #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1988, it lives on as a stadium anthem in Scotland, and in pubs everywhere.

It is a schmaltzy love song with a catchy refrain. If that's OK with you, give it a listen.

""And when I come home(When I come home), yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home with you.""

A37ZKZP74PYAVY,B0027OQ2ZY,1,1,5,"Bjork wasn't content in just starring in a movie she had to produce and write the music for the film, culminating in this soundtrack. Two words only are needed to sum up this soundtrack, Simply Beautiful. Bjork is such a musical genius, she is up in another league of women musicians, shared by only a select few.

But what makes Bjork such a wonderful musician is how she creates the most un believeable songs,whether it is an orchestral masterpiece (as shown on this album) or a sweeping ballad with a huge choir, Bjork has done that and much more.

She is in fact the most inventive musician there ever has been and ever will be. She is that good and this album proves it.

The first track to start this album is ""Overture"", well named as it is the overture to the film. This song starts with a deep string section and works its way into a fully rounded orchestral masterpiece. Bjork is well known for her use of orchestras in her music and this fully orchestra track is well worth the listen, because I don't really like classical music I was really ominous about this track, this is actually my favourite classical music piece ever.""Cvalda"" is a really weird song, it starts off with about 1 minutes worth of machine and factory sounds the finally -Clatter,crash,clack,racket,bang,thump- the first lyrics are as suggestive as the rest of the song, which is all over the place and sonically loud. Catherine Denevue makes a worthy appearance on this song and adds to the excitement and energy. On the next track Bjork ropes in another musical genius, Thom Yorke of Radiohead to create quite simply the most moving track the album along with -New World-. Now this is the song that is credited with me first getting into Bjork. One morning I was watching a music video show and I saw the video for this song and I instantly went searching for it. This song is so amazingly beautiful. Thom and Bjork work so well on this duet. ""Scatterheart"" is quite lenghty but well worth the listen and it has the most wonderful electronic programming in it. It talks about hurricanes and how -you are going to have to find out for yourself- quite a lyrical muddle but it is very well written. ""In The Musicals"" is a very good song that starts off with a basketball like sound. The irony is that -Dancer In The Dark- is classed as a musical and this song is about just that. It's strangely empowering and encouraging. ""107 Steps"" is Siobhan Fallon counting her steps and Bjork cooing every random number that comes along. Then finally at 107 (Or is it 100)steps there is an orchestral explosion and everything goes fantastic. Again she ropes in another beautiful guest to accompany her. ""New World"" is the 7th and final song on the album, although this album is short it is well worth the listen. This track is AMAZING and I didn't realise it was this wonderful for a while, a great example of how songs can come to grow on you.

10/10. This album may be short but every track is fantastic.

I thoroughly recommend this to anyone, of any age.","Two words only are needed to sum up this soundtrack , Simply Beautiful .

A1JUKS0DSO2XZG,B00FY3JV8A,1,1,5,"This scarcely needs a review because after 50 years practically everyone will know whether or not they like the Stones and most people considering this collection will know all the tracks on it very well indeed. It is worth saying, though, that this is a great collection. Obviously, any compilation like this will have some tracks you love and some you don't like so much, and some of your favourites will be missing (What - no Sister Morphine or Star...er...Star?) but as a ""Best Of"" collection I don't think you can do better. It is well selected and sounds fantastic: the digital transfers of the early stuff are particularly good and bring real life to the tracks without interfering with their original sound.

I suspect that quite a lot of people considering whether or not to buy this will be in the same position as I am: I have a lot of Stones music on LP and cassette and for me this was a good way of getting some of the best of it on CD. You certainly get plenty of great stuff, and personally I found listening to this was like running my life on fast forward from the age of about 10, with pretty well every track conjuring up where I was at the time. It's also great to hear the evolution of the band from the early covers, through finding their distinctive identity around the time of Satisfaction and through all their phases since. Although I haven't always liked the direction they have taken, this is a reminder that the Rolling Stones really are one of the finest bands of the last 50 years and that Jagger and Richards are a truly great songwriting team. The full range of classics is here, from the storming rockers like Jumpin' Jack Flash through to the hauntingly beautiful Angie. Also included is their new (November 2012) single Doom And Gloom which I think is excellent - a real Stones belter and one of their best tracks in ages.

The question, of course, is ""Do I need another Stones Greatest Hits album?"" the answer to which will depend on your own view and the state of your music collection. For me it's a great summary of their career containing some of my favourite ever tracks, and has made them available to me in CD format. If you want a good, well put-together collection of The Rolling Stones, you can't go wrong with this set.

In short, it's only rock 'n roll, but...","This scarcely needs a review or not they like the Stones and most people considering this collection will know all the tracks on it very well indeed .

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00OUVU2TO,1,1,4,"After pounding out an R.E.M. sound-alike in 2011 in the form of ""The King Is Dead,"" The Decemberists back up a bit for the more middle of the road ""What A Terrible World, What A Wonderful World."" There are some subtle changes, like heavier strings and horn charts, which are good. The band that crafted CD long suites now starts off an album with a song where the band apologizes for making a commercial for Axe Shampoo (""The Singer Addresses His Audience""). They know they aren't the same band that cut the masterful ""The Crane Wife,"" and openly admit such.

What they are for ""What a Terrible World..."" are a crafter of songs. They've found a sweet spot between the ornate structure of those early albums to a sense of pop melody. It makes a love song like ""Philomenia"" all the more jaunty and ""Lake Song"" a hip folkie haunter. The band also sound more integrated this time around, where ""The King Is Dead"" was a showcase for Chris Funk, here, piano dominates many of the songs.  Me. I kind of like when they get into that folk vein, as one of my favorites here Colin Malloy almost making a sea shanty song out of ""Better Not Wake The Baby.""

""What a Terrible World..."" will probably polarize fans who can't get over the fact that the band hit an early peak and then decided to try other things. As for me, I can respect that The Decemberists are not content to stay in one place for every album. Maybe they still aspire to be R.E.M. or even 10,000 Maniacs (some of the poetic lyrics recall the Maniacs'). What ever direction they travel, I am happy to follow as long as the music is this good.","After pounding out an R.E.M. sound - alike in 2011 in the form of "" The King Is Dead , "" The Decemberists back up a bit for the more middle of the road "" What A Terrible World , What A Wonderful World . "" There are some subtle changes , like heavier strings which are good . where the band apologizes for making a commercial for Axe Shampoo ( "" The Singer Addresses His Audience "" ) . They know they are not the same band that cut the masterful "" The Crane Wife , "" that cut the masterful "" The Crane Wife , "" and openly admit such . What they are for "" What a Terrible World ... "" are a crafter of songs . They have found a sweet spot between the ornate structure of those early albums to a sense of pop melody . It makes a love song like "" Philomenia "" all the more jaunty The band also sound more integrated this time around , where "" The King Is Dead "" was a showcase for Chris Funk , here , piano dominates many of the songs . I kind of like that folk vein , as one of my favorites here Colin Malloy almost making a sea shanty song out of "" Better Not Wake The Baby . ""

A18LYA95666ABF,B013H1HRDG,1,1,5,"A member of one of the most famous families from Bohemia, Franz Benda (1709-1789) entered into the service of Frederick the Great in 1732. As a violin master, he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period. He also wrote a lot of violin music, 110 solo capriccios, at least 150 sonatas, 31 duets and some 28 concertos, including this one in D Major.

With a crisply articulated intro, the Allegro ma non molto features a harpsichord continuo and string dominated orchestral support. As a transitional work from the Baroque, it contains more interplay between the single violin and the symphonic tutti than was the norm for the prevalent Italian style. Smoothly flowing, Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy, letting the melodic lines develop naturally. In the minor keyed Largo, the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova. With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register, she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that must be similar to the reported quality that set apart Bendas adagio playing. Horns appear for the brisk finale, a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string.

A generation or two later, Bohemian born Vaclav Pichl (1741-1805) studied philosophy and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan. After 21 years, he returned to Vienna and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace.
His D Major Concerto Op. 3, No. 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto, clipped and precise. While still employing the harpsichord as continuo, the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra, engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas, including one haunting echo in minor. A higher degree of technical proficiency of the single violin is also required.

A minor keyed charmer, the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings. Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin, the very first notes of the concluding Rondo. Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings, a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale.

By another Bohemian, the final concerto represents the culmination of the Viennese High Classical style. Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso, Antonin Vranicky (1761-1820) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos, one of which is the C Major included on this recording.

Using tympani and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors, the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto. Amid a longer, more extensive development section, the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows, the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register. After a chorale like start, the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close. Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto, the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance. With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm, this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude, dazzling flourishes from the violin and a rousing finish.

The original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine, placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear. Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik, the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos. But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova. This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry.

Please note that the 2008 edition includes a video bonus track of the bold Allegro giusto from Vranickys concerto in C Major.","A member of one of the most famous families from Bohemia , Franz Benda ( 1709 - 1789 ) entered into the service of Frederick the Great in 1732 .

With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm , this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude , dazzling flourishes from the violin The original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine , placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear . Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik , the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos . But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova . This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry . Please note that the 2008 edition includes a video bonus track of the bold Allegro giusto from Vranickys concerto in C Major ."

A24N1BAS3CU27H,B0043HA1K0,1,1,5,"Neo Soul crooner John Legend hooks up with Hip Hop collective The Roots to release ""Wake up!"", a collection of covers of socially/politically conscious Soul classics from the sixties and seventies. This has been a rather prolific year for The Roots as they released ""How I got over"" earlier in the year.

Both were inspired by the 2008 United States presidential election and chose songs they felt were obscure. The album has a loose live-jam feel to it with the only Hip Hop infusion being sporadic rapping by Black Thought or guest rappers.

The lone original composition is the church piano-driven ""Shine"". ""Humanity (Love the way it should be)"" is horn-sprinkled Reggae. They eschew the popular songs on Marvin Gaye's ""What's going on"" going for ""Wholy holy"".

Lead-off single ""Wake up everybody"" features Common and Melanie Fiona and is light and breezy. ""Hard times"" and ""Compared to what"" (with an incredibly groovy bassline and funky horns) are Funk/Soul, ""Little ghetto boy"" an airy organ-driven Jazz/Soul ballad, while ""I can't write left handed"" is a sprawling 12 minute epic, an anti-war lament originally done by Bill Whithers telling the story of a wounded war veteran writing a letter to his mother.

Each song stands out really, and what prevents the album from being too depressing and preachy are the excellent vocals and superb musicianship. A much needed wake up call musically.","This has been a rather prolific year for The Roots as they released "" How I got over "" earlier in the year .

A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,B00386JZ4U,-1,1,4,"We Five had a hit with ""You Were On My Mind"" in 1967.

It is the most rock oriented song on this album. By and large this is a mellow affair, with covers of ""Tonight,"" from West Side Story, and ""Cast Your Fate TO The Wind.""

But what makes We Five so good is they keep their vocal music in a folk vain. There is little orchestration here, and this music thus sounds like it could have been sung by 1960s college kids strumming on a street corner.

And We Five maintained their excellence: when most vocal groups were getting more sappy as rock got harder, We Five pushed in a more rustic and rocky direction.

A1BIBNY8ID4MWE,B009EAO6P2,1,1,5,"They've done Star Wars, Twilight, Lord of the Rings, ... It seems appropriate that the ""greatest movie song of all time"" gets the Piano Guys treatment. This song is one that easily converts to a classical piece. It has all the elements to become a powerful, emotional song. It starts out with an ""island beat"" that sounds like it could be played with a ukulele. Steven's ability to manipulate cellos to get the right sound for the song never ceases to amaze me. And Jon's familiarity with the piano gives the impression he's not only playing the piano, but ""playing"" with it; like a childhood toy. Mid way through, it crescendos and changes key. The arc of the song wraps around again and starts over, but this time the lightness and whimsy is replaced by the full emotion and power that throws the song into the majestic finale.
The video is filmed in Hawaii and the first half is right on the beach; the waves, literally, splashing at their heels as they play on the sand, rocks, and even a cliff. (a TPG trademark). The key-change shifts to a ridiculously green valley surrounded by equally green mountains; the planners and (piano) movers making the shift from one location to the other look effortless.
As ""overplayed"" as the original can be, I can listen to this version over and over again.
P. S.  If you are fortunate enough to get a hold of their concert DVD from Public Broadcasting, ""Live at Red Butte Garden"", they perform this song with lyrics sung by the One Voice Childrens Choir. It is beautifully performed and I hope an Mp3 or CD version will be available in the future. Once heard with the choir it is almost missed when heard without. -P. P. S. Bravo to those kids for singing so well that night; it was quite cold and I'm sure it took effort to stand out there in the wind and still keep a smile.","They have done Star Wars , Twilight , Lord of the Rings , ...

AA4VJFR1EDIN6,B008ZEIAYQ,1,1,5,"Lianne La Havas Is Your Love Big Enough is the one that got away in 2012.  La Havas didn't glide totally under the American radar. The Brit appeared on Carson Dalys show and she got a mention on NPR.

I actually learned about Is Your Love Big Enough while looking at the best of 2012 list compiled by an on-line magazine that I respect  Pop Matters. Ive been going there and comparing their list to ours for the last three years, and usually theres a lot of overlap. That was also the case in 2012.

Is Your Love Big Enough landed at number two on Pop Matters best R&B list. That piqued my curiosity and I was able to land a copy. However, I didn't listen right away. I finally got around to it about two weeks ago, and Ive hardly listened to anything else.

In many ways LaHavas is a fusion of the many of the female singers from Great Britain who have achieved varying levels of success in America over the last five years. Acoustic tunes such as Tease Me, Age  a witty tune in which the 23-year old singer/songwriter tells a tale of falling for a much older man  and the duet No Room For Doubt place La Havas in that folk and R&B fusion occupied by singer/songwriters such as the tragically overlooked Rachael Bell.

Tracks such as the sparse and melancholy Gone allow LaHavas to display vocal range. La Havas sings accompanied by a piano, an arrangement that gives the artist free range to showcase her powerful and soulful vocal instrument, and might remind listeners of power ballads rendered by Adele on her instant classic 21.

La Havas occupies her own space on the percussive Forget, a tune the singer wrote after a break-up. The track is a high-energy amalgamation of funk and rock in which La Havas showcases her deft fingering on her constantly present guitar. Her vocals  especially the hook where she yells fooorgeeet/all the words the let you break my heart combine the assertiveness of rock with one the one bounce of funk.

La Havas is a powerful and unique voice, and its a mystery to me why she hasn't attained the breakout success in America of Adele, Amy Winehouse, Corinne Bailey Rae or Joss Stone. Is Your Love Big Enough attests to the fact that La Havas artistic range and talent is large enough to operate in the territory occupied by all of those performers while also managing to sound distinctive.","Lianne La Havas Is Your Love Big Enough is the one I actually learned about Is Your Love Big Enough while looking at the best of 2012 list compiled by an on - line magazine that I respect   Pop Matters .

A2H1WNB30JNAWU,B004ATSTLY,1,1,4,"Halestorm release of their live in Philly 2010 was an amazing show with great engery, passion, desire that they show how much the music means to them while the fans show Lizzy and the band how much their music means to them.  I'll start with their CD performance very good vocals by miss Lizzy Halestorm followed by having the fans sing along with her to the songs.  As the concert continues onward Lizzy tells the people of Philly its good to be home and they got their start in Philly, only drawback though you can tell it's a live concert on two songs Love/Hate Heartbreak and Nothing to do with Love.  Postive though Lizzy shows their fans that she can do both hard rock songs plus the softer songs between the hard rock songs, one of my favorite songs though by them from the first album was the famililar taste of posion.  Then as concert keeps going we see how much RJ Lizzy's brother has so much passion for playing the drums,  to me Lizzy has the most haunting vocals ever for a singer and proves it over and over again on mutiple songs.  So out of 12 songs on the CD only 2 had feedback.  As for the DVD amazing show and you can see how much rock music means to Lizzy and the rest of the band as they rock out in front of their fans,  added bonus when you buy this CD/DVD combo you get 4 music videos to watch along with the concert.  In closing only took one star off because of those two songs with feedback and on the DVD seem to have two edited parts, what I mean is they had an extra song on the DVD that wasn't on the CD and second when she talks about coming home to Philly and the bands touring with them you don't hear her say they got their start here in Philly on the DVD.  But I enjoyed both the CD and DVD lots and I am sure if you buy this CD/DVD combo you will enjoy it as much as I did by just taking a chance on a live concert of a band I am sure you love listening to as much as I do.","Halestorm release of their live in Philly 2010 was an amazing show with great engery , passion , desire that they show how much the music means to them while the fans show Lizzy I will start with their CD performance very good vocals by miss Lizzy Halestorm followed by having the fans sing along with her to the songs .

Sparing no expense to work with some of the top people in the music industry, Shambhu set out from California for the bucolic splendor of Vermont to record at the studio of Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy winner Will Ackerman. To say that the supporting musicians are an all-star cast would be an understatement, and includes bassist Tony Levin, who plays with Peter Gabriel, Eugene Friesen of The Paul Winter Consort on cello, and a host of other top notch musicians who tour with the likes of Santana, Pat Metheny, Ravi Shankar, Yanni, and more.

But at the center of this luminous universe is acoustic guitarist and composer Shambhu. In his own words, ""My compositions reflect a diversity of musical influences from across the globe, from contemplative to Indian-jazz fusion to contemporary instrumental.""  All radiating a ""heartfelt feeling throughout."" This is simply some of the finest music of this type that I have ever heard. And I'm obviously not the only who thinks that, since the album was named ""One of the Best of the Year"" for contemporary music by Common Ground magazine and has received nominations for Best New Artist, Best Album of the Year, Best World Music CD, and Best Acoustic Instrumental CD. A track from this CD is featured on a recently released compilation entitled ""The Gathering,"" produced by Will Ackerman.

One of the outstanding features of this project is that it is actually a multi-media experience. Shambhu thoughtfully filmed the entire recording process, and in the beautiful accompanying booklet, entitled ""A Guide To The Journey,"" as well as on his website are links for the videos on YouTube, which I found absolutely fascinating.

The first Mudcrutch album was very good, but I think this one is even stronger. As another reviewer noted, there is indeed a Travelling Wilbury-esque vibe to many of these songs.

ASVNSWIXBV72Q,B0043X5TSS,1,1,4,"Recorded at a couple of pit stops in Germany, the Netherlands, Glasgow Scotland, Paris, Oslo, Stockholm, Denmark, Ireland, and six different English cities (Birmingham, Nottingham, Manchester, Newcastle, London, and Donington), the first live release from NOLA-based sludge/doom metal supergroup Down is spread out over the course of sixteen tracks and two separate discs. It is a weighty metal feast, that is for sure, but also one extremely satisfying and enjoyable one, and one that is overflowing with the good stuff: Great riffs, solos, and frontman Phil Anselmo's household wail. And 2010's ""Diary Of A Mad Band"" is also sparked with an excellent, palpable, and inescapable live energy, though each and every one of these songs is also flawlessly performed.

Tracks like the opening ""Losing All"" are fat with big, beefy, grinding riffage and wailing vocals, but are also peppered with a good batch of unorthodoxly ripping guitar soloing. This number is also of note for featuring quite a bit of crowd interaction, because it is one where Phil lets the concert-goers sing its chorus. ""Lifer"" goes out to ""Dimebag Darrell,"" and very appropriately so, too, because it is an up-tempo, deeply grooving riff-fest with plenty of noteworthy, wah-tinged lead/solo work to go along with its brutal guitar licks and cool, shrieking vocals. And later cuts like ""Rehab,"" which begins with the sound of Phil informing the crowd that he's taping the show, is very similar to ""Lifer,"" except that it has crashing cymbal rides in place of vocal shrieks.

Nearing the mid-section, Phil begins the next song, ""Temptations Wings"" by saying ""not to be effing generic or anything, but are you having a good time?!"" And really, it is almost impossible not to have one once you have heard this tune's serrated, grinding riffs, and the Down frontman's glorious, household wailing/screaming. Track six, ""Ghosts Along The Mississippi,"" might begin with an unnecessarily long intro, but once it dissolves into a white-hot ball of buzzsaw riffing and ripping soloing, it becomes very clear that it is another big standout. ""Learn From This Mistake"" is a slow-burning, low-key, and very brooding doom metal dirge peppered with some wailing, and totally air-guitar-able leads and solos, thus making it another standout; and ""Hail The Leaf,"" which is stuffed to the gills with chunky, chugging guitar licks, is another. (Although the latter of these two tunes is actually mostly of note for being a song that Down had not played live in a long time, and actually not even once overseas.)

Moving along, the first disc closes with one of its biggest highlights in ""New Orleans Is A Dying Ho,"" which again overflows with pounding doom riffs, whammy-bar-inflected leads, and fiery, inspiring solos. But this track is also of note for featuring quite a bit of crowd-involvement, as Phil leaves plenty of room in it for the crowd to sing part of the song's chorus.

The second disc opens on a misleading note, with ""Lies, I Don't Know What They Say, But..."" being backed by an ominous, bass-driven plod. But immediately following it, we are introduced to the big, fat, chugging riffage, grinding rhythms, pounding skins of the brutal bruiser that ensues in ""Underneath Everything."" A noteworthy solo also comes ripping through, here, too. Then, Anselmo tells the audience that he demands to ""see this place go berserk,"" an easy task, too, when considering this up-tempo fist pumper features lots of excellent riffs and solos.

Other highlights of the second disc include the really jazzy and bluesy ""Eyes Of The south"" (which ""goes out to a brother of ours: Mike Williams of Eyehategod"") that is immediately offset by an ensuing brutal, and booming riff-fest in ""Stone The Crows""; and the set closer, ""Bury Me In Smoke."" This one begins on a mildly comical note, as it is introduced with the joke that it is a Green Day cover. And ""Bury Me..."" is also of note because it, too, just oozes with amazing, serrated sludge/doom metal riffing.

""Diary Of A Mad Band"" serves as a great companion release to Down's excellent 2007 release, ""Over The Under,"" and a satisfying snack for you to listen to while the band is on one of its inexplicably extensive hiatuses. So even though it cannot be said to be a mandatory purchase, it is a worthwhile one for all hardcore fans of the band.","Recorded at a couple of pit stops in Germany , the Netherlands , Glasgow Scotland , Paris , Oslo , Stockholm , Denmark , Ireland , and Donington ) , the first live release from NOLA - based sludge / doom metal supergroup Down is spread out over the course of sixteen tracks that is for sure , but also one extremely satisfying and enjoyable one , that is overflowing with the good stuff : Great riffs , solos , and frontman Phil Anselmo 's household wail .

A2UYGOYMV73826,B008YO4EJC,1,1,5,"I attended a Greg Brown concert recently.  Bo Ramsey, in addition to being Greg's side man, opened the show and mentioned that he had worked on this album of Iris's which he highly recommended.

Stylistically, Iris DeMent is quite different from her husband.  Where GB is deep voiced, political, a touch crude, Iris is girlish, sincere, and quite twangy.  She reminds me of Gillian Welch in that throwback, red-dirt-girl kind of way.  Her voice is so distinctive and a bit of an acquired taste.  As she has gotten older the voice has mellowed.  It is so evocative of rural Arkansas where she was born.  Unlike Greg Brown, you will not find Iris with a pocket full of brand new songs.  Clearly she takes her time, thinks very carefully about what she wants to say and how to say it best.  This album is quite special and echoes the theme of Infamous Angel from 1992: Iris paying tribute to her mom and like a good daughter showing the wisdom of her mother's life lessons.

The record is truly a family affair.  Bo Ramsey is one of the family.  He is married to Greg's daughter Pieta Brown.  He tours with Greg and Pieta and has worked on everyone's albums.  Pieta gets the photo credits for the album, including the classic cover photo.  The other musicians on this album are not so familiar to me, but I like to imagine they are like family to Iris.  Fittingly, the album is dedicated to Dasha, the Russian-born daughter she and GB adopted several years ago.  I found it quite touching that she thanked Greg ""for never losing faith in me.""  I imagine the harder battle for this humble and talented woman is not to lose faith in herself.

I found myself unexpectedly moved to tears by Before the Colors Fade.  Another high point:  Mama Was Always Tellin' Her Truth.  But really, there is not a weak song on this album.  Maybe not too surprising if you figure she's been working on this one since her last album 16 years ago.  I plan to spend a lot of time listening to this one.  Iris DeMent has a lot to say and I want to hear every bit of it.

Update 9/9/13 - It's almost too embarrassing to admit, but I was enjoying this album again over the weekend and really took notice of the piano.  It is so fine.  And that is Iris herself playing that thing.  I am even more blown away than I was initially.  This is a very special album.","that he had worked on this album of Iris 's which he highly recommended .

It is like they took a gigantic leap between their first tenous steps and then finally realized their potential and started making some of the best rock music ever.  The book-let is very nice and the lyrics are typed in an easy to read font. They look dreadfull though and those haircuts make them look like hobos. Apart from this is a work of True genius and they set a standard for rock muisicans that have been met by very few artists indeed, roling stones being one of them. This collection has some of their best tracks ever written and I could go on and on about it but if I had to pick a few then it is strawberry fields forever, across the universe and here comes the sun.

A23LHYBAB2SXWC,B00471GFJ8,1,1,4,"ABiCA who have been on the music underground for a few years now, even releasing 3 albums along the way, but it is with this release ""Numb"" that is now taking the band out of the underground scene and into the mainstream! ""Numb"" which is also considered the bands first official release is a blend of many styles from rap, hip hop, rock and even dance. If you thought you knew ABiCA with their previous releases then this album is gonna hit you hard as it's a giant leap in quality.

Hash and Tac who are the two mcs/vocalists in ABiCA have a great interplay style, it helps that they both have distinct voices and don't sound like each other. The album opens with the soft sound of piano keys on title track ""Numb"" before the vocals kick in, it's a brave move for a band to start a debut album on such a quiet note, in reality it's just easing you into the next 55 minutes of varying styles. ""Tell Us Why"" comes bouncing out with heavy beats and industrial sounding guitars as Tac and Hash are joined by Binary Audio who were two thirds of the British band Radiator, Janne Jarvis joins on vocals and the song has a real Nine Inch Nails style to it. ""Turn Me On"" has a great interplay of vocals and keeps the album flowing into ""My Song"" which features former memeber Cant on vocals, the track is a hip hop delight and will keep longtime ABiCA fans happy. The track features a cool loop throughout the track.

""The things You Think I Say"" features Approaching Nirvana on vocals and he gives the song a Linkin Park laid back sound. ""The Pursuit"" sounds like vintage ""Licensed To Ill"" Beastie Boys. ""Take This Away"" starts with a haunting piano and has Hash delivering some heavy lines as Tac sings in the background, it's a perfect example of both members varying styles working rally well. On ""I Can Be Real"" ABiCA get real heavy, with some big drums and heavy guitars, the song is produced by Tweaker Ray who has mixed many a Nine Inch nails song himself, his production qualities really shine on the track.

ABiCA even give us a big dance sounding track on ""Gave Em A Reason"" a track that features a big chorus. Former member Cant appears again on ""Blurry"". The final track ""What You See"" is a rock stomper with Tac leading the vocal duties, it's a great way to finish off the album. The only complaint you can really level at the album is that at 16 songs it might be too long, especially for a debut and considering the short attention span climate we now live in.

With ""Numb"" ABiCA have set the mark high for their next album, which should be ready to go by late 2011 early 2012. It's amazing to think the Tac and Hash have produced and released their own album, the sound quality is great as good as you would get on any major record label release, the artwork is cool with detailed information on who produced and engineered what as well as what the guest performers roll in each track was. ABiCA have drawn many comparisons to Linkin Park, Nine Inch Nails, Eminem and the Beastie Boys, for me they sound a bit like Pop Will Eat Itself ""Dos Dedos Mis Amigos"" era a former English band who featured Black Swan composer Clint Mansell on Vocals. ABiCA are determined to get their name out there, and even on Hash's album notes he encourages you to share the album with other people. ABiCA ""Numb"" deserves to be heard by a wide audience!!","but it is with this release "" Numb "" "" Numb "" If you thought you knew ABiCA with their previous releases then this album is going to hit you hard as it is a giant leap in quality . who are the two mcs / vocalists in ABiCA have a great interplay style , it helps and do not sound like each other .

A2582KMXLK2P06,B001NT3RGG,1,1,5,"I don't like Grease at all.  The entire film strikes me as a really laughable and poorly acted exaggeration of a play with lots of dancing, jumping around and goofy stage antics (even though I'm aware the actors and singers are acting that way because they're totally into the music, which is awesome).  However if we ignore all that and listen exclusively to the music, you'd find yourself having a total blast with some of these songs.  The best of which is this one, ""You're The One That I Want"".  Simply put, I LOVE THIS SONG!  I have no idea why.  There's no rational reason behind it.  I really shouldn't love it as much as I do.

In fact when I found out from an oldies radio station that a much younger John Travolta sings it, I nearly got the shock of my life!  But... I give in!  I simply can't resist the jerky rhythm and the *incredible on all kinds of unexplainable levels* way Olivia Newton John sings the verse melody.  I mean she's absolutely ELECTRIFYING!  Oh, and this is without a DOUBT the best example of a song where the verse melody is significantly leagues better than the chorus.  The chorus sounds like a bunch of chickens popping out of their bed and going ""YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I WANT, OH OH OH!"" but the verse... ""You better shape up!  'Cuz I need a man!  Who can keep me satisfied!""  AWESOME SONG!

I suppose there is one scene I like from Grease.  It's when this song is playing, and John Travolta is so hyperactive over Olivia's dancing moves he's basically rolling around at the bottom of the stairs like a caged monkey that just escaped a lab experiment, haha.","I do not like Grease at all .

A1QR9CS347XKFC,B00JYKU6BK,1,1,4,"I was a slow comer to Linkin Park. When they emerged with the other nu-metal bands I didn't find them particularly distinguishable from the others. I figured they were another flash in the pan, one hit wonder. I was wrong. One thing they've proven throughout the course of their career is reliability in good song writing, and impressive chemistry as bandmates. The Hunting Party lacks gimmickry, and is probably the first album they've done that feels like it's just a band playing together. No loops, no electronica, no excessive polish. It all sounds like a band got together in a room and knocked out some killer, high energy tunes.

The Hunting Party has the best of Linkin Park - Big, hooky singalong choruses, rap/singing structures, and a new innovation for them...raw, unvarnished grit. This here is straight forward, blast the stereo speakers RAWK. Perhaps the biggest letdown is the instrumental track with Tom Morello, which showcases absolutely nothing of Morello's skills. You'd never know that was Tom Morello playing if it weren't for the liner notes.

Small gripe. Everything on here is quality otherwise. Linkin Park has served up a refreshing nugget of pure rock, filling a void in a genre gasping for relevance. Hats off to them for the risky move with a big payoff.","I was a slow comer to Linkin Park . I figured they were another flash in the pan , one hit wonder . I was wrong .

AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B003MLW01G,1,1,4,"I eagerly bought and listened to Dierks Bentley's first three albums.  They were different than everything else on the radio; True, he was pretty much following the formula set down by Waylon Jennings (and even lifted a few of Waylon's rhythms), but it was still a nice change from the regular mainstream pace.  And then Bentley kind of petered out; MODERN DAY DRIFTER and LONG TRIP ALONE just weren't as good as his debut, even if they featured a handful of amazing songs.

That's why I didn't really pay attention when Bentley released a new album (I completely ignored his last couple).  Yet, when I began listening to the tracks and discovered that it was a bluegrass album, I bought it.  I'm all for mainstream singers cutting loose Nashville's chains and doing what they want (I'm waiting for the day Toby Keith decides to give radio the finger...still waiting...I should probably give up...).  UP ON THE RIDGE is, at its heart, a bluegrass concept album, filled with minor-key songs about love and life.  Some have decidedly upbeat lyrics (""Fiddlin' Around""), and some use up-tempo melodies to convey not-so-happy lyrics (""You're Dead to Me"" and ""Bad Angel"").  Yet this is not a feel-good album; it's an album by a man not quite happy with his musical surroundings (Bentley hasn't had a genuine hit in a few years, I don't think), who has decided to play outside radio.  RIDGE won't have much radio success; in this day and age of hick anthems, blindly patriotic lyrics, and bubblegum pop sensibilities, country music has turned its bearded cheek to bluegrass.  So be it; quite a few of us don't even bother turning the radio on anymore (God bless satellite radio, though).

Bentley is joined by a few compatriots, notably from outside mainstream country: Del McCoury, Chris Thile, the Punch Brothers, Jamey Johnson, Miranda Lambert, Kris Kristofferson, Vince Gill, and producer/songwriter Jon Randall.  Some of the material here is top notch: Bentley shines on Kristofferson's darkly humorous ""From the Battle to the Bottom,"" even if he doesn't capture the original's whimsy (and Kristofferson, unfortunately, is not in top form voice-wise, though he's still a welcome addition); ""Down in the Mine"" is a hauntingly beautiful tune; ""Bad Angel"" features engaging performances by Lambert and Johnson, two of the few reasons to actually listen to contemporary country music.  Some other songs are solid, if not among Bentley's best, and while Bob Dylan's ""Senor"" is a wonderful skeptic's tune, it doesn't quite fit Bentley or the album (it's more Chris Thile's territory, which is probably why he sings on it).

Overall, UP ON THE RIDGE is a solid album from a man who's finally doing what he wants (again; I still say his debut album was a fine example of classic-style country music).  It won't sell as well as his previous records, and it won't overwhelm radio with any hits, and casual fans who expect the usual mainstream affair will be turned off.  But those of us who appreciate high-caliber music with genuine soul, music that comes from an old, deep place that is never mined out, will rejoice at the album.  It's not a classic, and it has its weak spots, but it's still a fine return to form for Dierks Bentley, who's still one of the more promising country artists out there.","I eagerly bought They were different than everything else on the radio ; True , he was pretty much following the formula set down by Waylon Jennings ( but it was still a nice change from the regular mainstream pace .

A173RNRO9C8YJN,B001GFKIBE,1,1,5,"First, a point of reference.  When this was originally released, this was the only compilation of late '60's Beatles songs available.  Perfect for the 8-track player and listening to in the car on long trips.  Plus, this had the version of ""Let It Be"" with a different guitar solo than the LP version.  All the songs here were played on the radio extensively (OK, maybe not ""Old Brown Shoe"") and that's why this was essential back in the day.  Now?  Maybe not, with all the CD's released since 1987.  Back in the day, it was hard to find some people who did not like the Beatles.  I find it interesting to read the negative comments of Beatles and Stones CD's to see if I have been wrong all these years.  I am glad that many young people (those born 1980 or later) have embraced the Beatles for the musical legacy they left us.  For those who just don't like them, well, that's their opinion and that keeps things interesting if you truly in fact do not like the music.
As for reviewing this CD, all the songs are great.  Not a bad one here.  Should be familiar to all Beatles fans.  This set (along with the Red Album) is a fine introduction for someone new to rock music.  Could some extra tracks have been added?  Of course.  But look at what happened with the releases of the 87 CDs.  I guess Capitol did not want to tinker with the original product.  So, for those from back in the day, or someone looking for a set of songs to keep in the car for listening, this does the trick.  Hopefully this will encourage new listeners to further explore the works of John, Paul, George and Ringo, and bring a smile to the faces of those of us who were there back in the day.","When this was originally released , this was the only compilation of late ' 60 's Beatles songs available .

The singer eloquently expresses how a persons words can greatly hurt based on how much they meant to you. I can relate to this song all too well due to my reluctant acceptance to come to terms with being the black sheep/oddball of my family (I only finally accepted being the family black sheep a month ago instead of perpetually fighting against it). Fortunately, some family members do accept me, however I now embrace that others may never get me or like me regardless of what I do or say (such as my adoptive father). However, instead of feeling sorry for myself, I take it as a positive lesson why I must continue to live independently and reside in the location I feel is best for my husband and I (regardless of what both family members and strangers to me may say). For You by Staind brilliantly professes the heavy emotion that one can feel around the heavy task of not letting frequent and continual verbal attacks and/or social exclusion penetrate ones emotional/psychological armor.

I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo
In so much space.""

It's more powerful than a lot of bands with lyrics. It shows that the lyrics and vocals aren't the most important part and you don't need them. Trent Reznor shows his musical talent more. Some songs are more industrial and faster similar to other NIN songs. Some of them are also slower, more unique and atmospheric. Trent Reznor makes every album original and they all sound different, some more than others. Ghosts and Broken are almost 100% different. I don't understand why somone would give this a 1 star review. It kept my interest and I was amazed by it.","Ghosts I - IV is absolutely amazing , their best since The Fragile .

He has more range and smoothness in this song than any other - perhaps it's the message that he's trying to send to all believers, and his convictions are well made in the lyrics of this song; quite spooky when you listen to what he has to say, as it applies in the current age as much as it did in 1990, 2001, and now.  I put this song right up there second only to ""Ring of Fire"".  This is Johnny Cash at his best.","My summary says it all - Johnny Cash was never in ' better voice ' than and his convictions are well made in the lyrics of this song ; quite spooky I put this song right up there second only to "" Ring of Fire "" .

AGEIT17HENDIS,B000W1AO4Y,-1,-1,3,"I first heard the compelling nasally slow draw (in the good sense) voice of Lucinda Williams on tribute albums. First, on the Hank Williams tribute album, ""Timeless"", where she did a cover of his classic tale of love's trials and tribulations ""Cold, Cold Heart"". I mentioned in a review of that CD that very seldom did anyone cover a Hank Williams song better than he did himself. I noted the exception of Lucinda on that rendition of ""Cold, Cold Heart"". I also made the same statement on her cover of Mississippi John Hurt's ""Beulah Land"" on his tribute album. Finally, I noted the fine job that she did on a duet with John Prine on ""Wedding Bells"" on his ""In Spite Of Ourselves"" cover album of country classics.

That said, although I have high, very high regard for Ms. Williams' cover work I am more ambivalent about her own albums. This album under review is such a case. I do not understand what is driving her on some of these songs. She, obviously, can write thoughtfully of love, lost, the cruel nature of the world, her family and other subjects but for the most part that feeling I got from the above-mentioned efforts is missing here. A few do, however, stand out. ""Mama You Sweet"", ""Words"", ""West"" and ""Rescue"" clearly rise to the occasion. As I say, the rest is so-so and suffer a little from trying to cross-over from her country base.","I first heard the compelling nasally slow draw ( in the good sense ) voice of Lucinda Williams on tribute albums . where she did a cover of his classic tale of love 's trials and tribulations "" Cold , Cold Heart "" . that very seldom did anyone cover a Hank Williams song better than he did himself . that rendition of "" Cold , Cold Heart "" .

A9IZ4H60VZMMT,B00TQTGU1Y,1,1,4,"Things to expect with this release:

Chill, minimal analog sound textures and fragments. Perfect for relaxing with a nice pair of headphones. Its a warm, trippy experience. At times, the tracks have a Kraftwerk feel to them. Fans of minimal synth and modern Euro-Rack enthusiasts will eat this album up.

Things not to expect with this release:

Pop hooks, vocals, or catchy material meant for safe consumption. The structures of these ""songs"" do not follow the usual Depeche format and are entirely experimental.

As a fan of instrumental electronic music and Depeche Mode, I think its a cool album. Not essential by any means, but its a fun ride meant more for chill sessions than a night drive through the city. Personally, I think the average Depeche Mode fan will dislike this record due to its uncommercial nature. However, folks who enjoy analog synthesizers for the magic and texture they provide will find plenty to appreciate with MG.

Recommended.","Things to expect with this release :

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000VRLBH8,-1,-1,3,"I heard from a few people that Brian McKnight's latest album Gemini is his best album in a while, so I checked it out and now I'm wondering why I was misled. Brian was doing fine with his first two albums (his self-titled album and I Remember You), but then came Anytime, which, despite its success, was one of those albums that made you say, ""Well, at least he's releasing the right songs."" While he did get his groove back and then some with Back At One, his following two albums (Superhero and U-Turn) were weak. And this album isn't much different.

It's not that Brian can't sing any more; it's just that there are too many missteps that can't be ignored. Things do start off with a bang, though, with ""What We Do Here"" and ""Everytime You Go Away"". But then comes the embarrassing ""Grown Man Business"", which makes it obvious that Brian still hasn't learned that trying to cater to the young crowd has never worked for him (ever hear the original version of ""Hold Me"" off Anytime?).

Things also fail when guest rappers come aboard. I have no idea what Talib Kweli is doing on this album, but he kicks a lame verse on an already corny ""She"". But even worse than that is when Akon, Juvenile, Skip and some unknown femcee help Brian deliver the 106 & Park-ready ""Whatcha Gonna Do"". Brian still struggles by himself, though, especially with lyrics like ""I reach around and grab a little booty/And it feels so good"" (from ""Here With You""). ""All Over Now"" is another young crowd pleaser gone wrong.

While the album comes to a remarkable close with ""Your Song"" and ""Me & You"", this album really show's Brian's vocal skills and not much else. At this point, I'd only suggest you buy Gemini to complete your Brian McKnight collection.

It's nimble, light-speed basslines and breakneck drum work. It's three young men whose vocals are a rallying cry to the spirit of True punk music.

Finally Lester, Kalel, Noah and Rob together again making an album after the last one they released together was For The Love of The Game. I love One Love Revolution, it sorta has a mixture of WDWGFH, Fireproof, and The Reckoning if you were to the sound of those albums and throw them together.

ASVNSWIXBV72Q,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"All of Type O Negative's usual elements are still firmly in place on their seventh full-length. For example, really memorable, Sabbath-inspired guitar riffing, good solos, prominent, grumbling bass lines, Peter Steele's masculine yet limpid vocals (including a baritone that is so deep, it almost matches his bass sound), both humorous and depressing lyrics, creepy keyboards, well-written melodies, bullying grooves, gothic overtones, occasional psychedelic sounds, and solid drumming are all definitely very much apart of the band's famous arsenal.

But there is also an intangible something and feeling of greatness present on 2007's ""Dead Again,"" making it easily their finest release since 1996's iconic ""October Rust."" For one, there should be absolutely no question as to if Type O are just phoning it in and/or recycling old material (which was something that some fans believed to be the case on 1999's ""World Coming Down"" and 2003's ""Life Is Killing Me""), because they now sound as inspired, energetic, and all-around strong as ever! Plus, they can't be said to exactly reinvent the genre here, but thanks to the rather broad and sophisticated songwriting on display here, these 10 songs do possess a fairly refreshing  and unpredictable quality. The album shuffles back and forth between several different moods and genres, including really heavy doom metal, sludge, thrash (thus showing-off Steele's roots in the genre, as a founding member of Carnivore), goth metal, industrial, and progressive and traditional rock. It is viscerally heavy and frequently quite fast, yet (in True T.O.N. style), it also retains a certain level of control and tunefulness throughout. Suffice it to say, this is one very rewarding, well-rounded, and epically epic piece of music. In addition, at 77 minutes in length (!), it should be more than long enough to satiate all fans' appetites for the foreseeable future.

The terrifically ominous and choir-abetted intro of the title track begins thins on a creepy note. It then segues into propulsive speed metal territory -- a rollicking groove, strong bass work throughout, and a sing-song-y chorus to add catchiness. ""Tripping A Blind Man"" works similarly: An old-school Black Sabbath-meets-Eighties thrash (i.e., say, Megadeth) piece with a neat gothic keyboard beginning before suddenly becoming almost crushing and breakneck when blazing tempos, fast guitar leads, and an exceptional solo (near the end) slam onto the scene. ""The Profits Of Doom"" falls somewhere between My Dying Bride, Crowbar, Acid Bath, Deep Purple, and Alice In Chains. It is a slow and extremely progressive, slow-burning, brooding, and trance-inducing epic which nears the eleven minute mark and has thunderous, trudging power chords that weigh a ton, a beefy bottom-end completed by noteworthy, and dirty, grungy-sounding bass lines, and vocals that trade-off between growling, eerie spoken-words, and impressive, proper singing.

On the flip side, ""September Sun"" is a very pretty, somber, textured, tranquil, and emotionally-moving Alice Cooper-esque ballad that is peppered with cool piano keys, melodic strings, and warm and powerful crooning. The lyrics are also worth mentioning here, because they are so sad and dark that it wouldn't be surprising if they leave a lump in the listener's throat. Next up, ""Halloween In Heaven"" is much catchier and more accessible than usual. Here, a memorable, driving, stoner metal-ish main riff is accented nicely by soaring, clean backing female vocals. At fourteen and-a-half-minutes long, song number six, ""These Three Things,"" takes the cake for being the set's pinnacle and is possibly the biggest highlight to be found here. It is an extremely dark, goth-y, and stormy piece based primarily on droning guitars and muscular bass work, but it also makes sure to include numerous different facets, and lots of nice subtleties, atmosphere, and mood-enhancers.

Taking a break from their more experimental side, ""She Burned Me Down"" is more proof that, when they want to, Type O Negative can always kick out pure doom metal with the best of them, and is highlighted by excellent, mesmerizing riffage, emotional vocals, and a fiery and winding guitar solo. ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" again takes things into an up-tempo pace; in fact, one could argue it sounds kind of like a Motorhead tune. It is centered around storming (and sometimes almost punk-y) drumming (including a few bass kicks), call-and-response choruses, and a steadfastly meaty and sludgy bass bottom. The curiously entitled ""An Ode To Locksmiths"" boasts a leather-clad rock `n' roll vibe, tasty, crunchy, lumbering guitars, and Ozzy Osbourne-inspired singing. Finally, the closing ""Hail And Farewell To Britain"" once again downshifts into depressive doom territory, with a bass-heavy mix, big, fat, chugging guitar riffs, lock-step-unison rhythms, and a great keyboard solo.

Cutting to the chase, ""Dead Again"" is, quite simply, one very amazing album, and an essential listen. And it is the sound of a band that is easily firing on all cylinders; hence, contrary to its misleading title, it is also proof that this band has never sounded more alive/lively. However, in an oh-so-cruel twist-of-fate, Peter Steele passed away from heart failure in April 2010, at the age of 48. But even if we are faced with the sad truth that we will now never again hear anything new from T.O.N., at least fans can take solace in the fact that the frontman lead a remarkable career, and unquestionably went out on the absolute top.

R.I.P. Peter, you will be missed.","All of Type O Negative 's usual elements are still firmly in place on their seventh full - length . For example , really memorable , Sabbath - inspired guitar riffing , good solos , prominent , grumbling bass lines , Peter Steele 's masculine that is so deep , it almost matches his bass sound ) , both humorous and depressing lyrics , creepy keyboards , well - written melodies , bullying grooves , gothic overtones , occasional psychedelic sounds , and solid drumming are all definitely very much apart of the band 's famous arsenal . and feeling of greatness present on 2007 's "" Dead Again , "" making it easily their finest release since 1996 's iconic "" October Rust . "" For one , there should be absolutely no question as to if Type O are just phoning it in and/or recycling old material ( that some fans believed to be the case on 1999 's "" World Coming Down "" and 2003 's "" Life Is Killing Me "" ) , because they now sound as inspired , energetic , and all - around strong as ever ! but thanks to the rather broad and sophisticated songwriting on display here , these 10 songs do possess a fairly refreshing and unpredictable quality . and genres , including really heavy doom metal , sludge , thrash ( and progressive and frequently quite fast , yet ( in True T.O.N. style ) , it also retains a certain level of control Suffice it to say , this is one very rewarding , well - rounded , In addition , at 77 minutes in length ( ! ) , it should be more than long enough to satiate all fans ' appetites for the foreseeable future . The terrifically ominous and choir - abetted intro of the title track begins thins on a creepy note . It then segues into propulsive speed metal territory -- a rollicking groove , strong bass work throughout , "" Tripping A Blind Man "" works similarly : An old - school Black Sabbath - meets - Eighties thrash ( i.e. , say , Megadeth ) piece with a neat gothic keyboard beginning before suddenly becoming almost crushing when blazing tempos , fast guitar leads , and an exceptional solo ( near the end ) slam onto the scene . "" The Profits Of Doom "" falls somewhere between My Dying Bride , Crowbar , Acid Bath , Deep Purple , It is a slow and extremely progressive , slow - burning , brooding , that weigh a ton , a beefy bottom - end completed by noteworthy , and dirty , grungy - sounding bass lines , that trade - off between growling , eerie spoken - words , and impressive , proper singing . On the flip side , "" September Sun "" is a very pretty , somber , textured , tranquil , that is peppered with cool piano keys , melodic strings , and warm and powerful crooning . The lyrics are also worth mentioning here , because they are so sad and dark that it would not be surprising if they leave a lump in the listener 's throat . Next up , "" Halloween In Heaven "" is much catchier and more accessible than usual . Here , a memorable , driving , stoner metal - ish main riff is accented nicely by soaring , clean backing female vocals . and - a - half - minutes long , song number six , "" These Three Things , "" takes the cake for being the set 's pinnacle and is possibly the biggest highlight to be found here . It is an extremely dark , goth - y , and stormy piece based primarily on droning guitars and muscular bass work , but it also makes sure to include numerous different facets , and lots of nice subtleties , atmosphere , and mood - enhancers .

The sounds of groups like The Moonglows, The Heartbeats, and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers would have a profound influence on founding group members Charlie and Rich Ingui.

In the mid 1960's The Soul Survivors began to build a strong following, playing venues in Atlantic City and Philadelphia. Enjoying great success in Philadelphia, they attracted the attention of record producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Into the recording studio they went, emerging with "" Expressway To Your Heart "" a song that would climb to #3 on Billboard's R&B chart and #4 on the Hot 100 Singles pop chart. The success of ""Expressway"" would become Gamble and Huff's first ""crossover"" hit when it began to be played on both black and white radio stations.

In polls taken by both the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphias City Paper, "" Expressway"" was voted the number one record ever to come out of Philadelphia.

While he has had a lot of highs, musically and personally, the past several years have been very hard for him. With his marriage to Heidi Klum ending, and his albums not as strong as they used to be, he seems to be at a personal crossroads in his life. Nothing he has done in music has ever had the impact he made with Kiss From A Rose, from the Batman Forever soundtrack and off his second self-titled album. The song is still his biggest opus that is just as good today, as it was when it came out in 1994. It definitely is a great download if you are new to Seal's music, or if you want to hear what a real voice is like, and not something that is weighed down. Hopefully, Seal can come out with something as distinctive as he did back then.

They in fact have done soundtrack work and are on the Powerpuff Girls soundtrack 'Heroes and Villains'. So I'm not saying their rendition is bad ...just different.

I like the song well enough, but it isn't something I'd play every day. The rest of 'Osaka Romones' sounds much the same, so if you like enjoy Shonen Knife's take on ""Rock N Roll High School"" and J-Pop in general, then you might want to add it to your Cloud Player and jam out with the three girls from Osaka.

"" Rock N Roll High School "" is a track from their latest album ' Osaka Romones - Tribute To The Ramones ' ( available only in MP3 format currently ) . It is a cheerful version rather than the&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/angrier - original / dp / B00000JFUY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">angrier original</a>&nbsp;and sounds like something you might hear while watching ' Teen Titans ' or some other modern kids cartoon . They in fact have done soundtrack work and are on the Powerpuff Girls soundtrack ' Heroes and Villains ' . So I am not saying their rendition is bad ... just different . I like the song well enough , but it is not something I would play every day .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000W21FZU,1,1,4,"If there is honestly one thing that I do adore about Sting, is that has been a master artist at really making great songs on his own. He has been doing it for 30 years on his own, and nearly 40 years as a part of The Police. I do however find his solo work to really deliver nicely from Jazz and Soul to all the way to Rock. But when he has a song come out, people will really listen to him, most of the time. When it came down to his Brand New Day album in 1999, many people weren't very eager at listening to the album at first, after the title track was released. However when Desert Rose was released as a single, many people really flocked over to the album. Desert Rose from the Brand New Day album is one of those hypnotic songs of Sting's that is soulful and very hypnotic to his work. I definitely think it is one of his Top 5 songs to have ever came out in the 90's. Next to If I Ever Lose Me Faith In You and Fields Of Gold. This is one song that I definitely recommend downloading if you are a Sting fan.

I don't know what this album means or what this Green Day will become in the future, but now that the trilogy is complete I am happy with what I got. I feel that there is so much more that Green Day has to offer and from a band that many felt would never amount to anything, almost 25 years strong I am excited for their next record.","and meaningful album about embracing youth Of course Green Day does get loud in a few songs , that the trilogy is complete I am happy with what I got . and from a band that many felt would never amount to anything , almost 25 years strong I am excited for their next record . that many felt would never amount to anything , almost 25 years strong I am excited for their next record ."

A4AXRDJFGQYDL,B00AH34AUQ,-1,-1,3,"Uno started of OK but quickly became boring, Dos was great right from the get-go, Tre is a letdown. It was billed as the arena rock album but in reality is an album where the slow numbers shine and the rockers fail. I can't imagine Green Day playing these tracks live a whole bunch in the future. It seems an album made up of what was left over from the other albums. My guess is they've pulled out two albums worth of tracks that go together and what was left is served here. The problem here is most of what's been served up doesn't cut it. Many of the songs come and go and you don't even notice them.

(B+) - Brutal Love is the highlight of the album. It's almost a straight rip off of several other songs including The Beatles' Oh Darling. Also close to the formula of Oh Love (including the `copy the tune' guitar solo) and is similarly a tad overlong. I like it though, however!!
(C+) - Missing You is OK but only good filler
(C) - 8th Avenue is standard filler
(B+) - Drama Queen is a slower number one of the better tracks though perhaps a tad disturbing...
(B+) - X-Kid is the best of the `rockers' and a definite highlight
(C+) - Sex, Drugs and Violence is a bit of nothing
(C) - A Little Boy Named Train keeps the nothing going
(C+) - Amanda solidifies the run of nothing. It's no Amy but maybe on par with Ashley.
(B+) - Walk Away picks things up and is one of the few highlights.
(C) - Dirty Rotten Bastards surely can't be taken seriously. Just too many rip-offs of other songs for me to like this one. Carmen? and Marine's Hymn or is it Auld Lang Syne?
(C) - 99 Revolutions brings us back to a nothing song. Identical start to Lazy Bones but is nowhere near the quality.
(C+) - The Forgotten is OK (there's a lot of just OK stuff here) but not up there with their best ballads. It doesn't really go anywhere

So unfortunately, at the end of the three albums my fears have been realised - that there's only really one album worth of great material. You could argue two good albums worth of tracks but what would be the point of releasing two? It needed to be three or one but the three hasn't really cut it. Good on them for having a go and I doubt many others could have done better.","Uno started of OK but quickly became boring , Dos was great right from the get - go , Tre is a letdown . where the slow numbers shine and the rockers fail .

( B+ ) - X - Kid is the best of the ` rockers ' and a definite highlight and Violence is a bit of nothing It is no Amy ( C ) - Dirty Rotten Bastards surely can not be taken seriously . Just too many rip - offs of other songs for me to like this one . Identical start to Lazy Bones The Forgotten is OK ( there is a lot of just OK stuff here ) but not up there with their best ballads . It does not really go anywhere 

 So unfortunately , at the end of the three albums my fears have been realised - that there is only really one album worth of great material . You could argue two good albums worth of tracks but the three has not really cut it . Good on them for having a go and I doubt many others could have done better ."

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00EW0VRQ0,-1,-1,2,"When it has came down to new artists they have to really find their voices. Sevyn Streeter, whom sung back up for Chris Brown on his Michael Jackson sampled hit She Ain't You, has a lot to prove from her own spotlight. Sadly, for her debut single It Won't Stop, I found the song to not even ignite at all. It felt more like Chris Brown was taking over with the song a bit more than her rhythm. She really didn't bring out more from the voice to stand and drive her sensual rhythm. I think if she wants to thrive in it for the long run, she needs to find ore from her voice to say it won't stop. Because for her and from her, it just didn't feel like it stood from the song. Hopefully, if her debut record comes around, there will be more than just a second of heartbeats in song.

""Return to Paradise"" might just be; what with those beautiful Falsetto vocals, ""Georgia"" might  be an under-rated one of those Southern Anthems that filled up ""Tumbleweed Connection"". But, for me, the real nuggets are the final three songs ""Madness"", ""Reverie"" and ""Song for Guy"", which all sit well together, kind of a trio of darkness, really; ""Madness"" is a spine chilling disco-prog-rocker with lots of haunting piano chords; ""Reverie"" is brief but effective, and ""Song for Guy"" is suitably melancholy and ethereal, given it's essentially a requiem. The vocal part is particularly evocative.

The other songs aren't bad. ""I don't care"" is a fun rocker in the style of his earlier ones, but the vocals don't relay the fun.

A23OB9FM3MUYXT,B00137MMAU,1,1,5,"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic ""Un-break My Heart""; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, ""Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain..."" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with catharsis - as she is.

Braxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, ""Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!"" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like ""Mourning Becomes Electra"" with the lights turned down.

This in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.

""Bring back the nights when I held you beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry this tears
I cried so many, many nights

Un-break my heart oh baby

A15T3Y3BL2AJ9V,B001NTDU18,1,1,5,"Quarterflash was formed in Oregon in 1980. The singer and sax player is Rindy Ross, wife of Marv Ross, guitarist. What makes this band different is the fact that the front vocalist also plays the saxophone. Rindy stated at one time that she uses the saxophone as an extension of her voice enabling her to put more feeling and emotion to a given song which her voice alone, in her opinion, would not be able to achieve. The self-titled album was released in the latter part of 1981. Almost a year later it went Platinum, meaning more than a Million copies sold. This song is performed impeccably, very well arranged and executed. It is a True classic of the '80s. I like this song very much. Their other songs are not bad either, but this is the tune that put Quarterflash to a #7 slot in the charts. The MP3 sound quality is better than what I had expected.","that the front vocalist also plays the saxophone . that she uses the saxophone as an extension of her voice enabling her to put more feeling which her voice alone , in her opinion , would not be able to achieve .

July Flame or Saltbreakers and slightly uneven, not that I didn't like it.
Perhaps the song ""That Alice"" is the key to this album--Ms. Veirs tastes are
beyond solely the world of pop, the song is about Alice Coltrane and
contains a brilliant, ""ragged"" guitar solo (by Ms. Veirs) that is Jazz inspired.
I have come to love this CD as much as the aforementioned albums not
just for the beauty and creativity of the songs but also that it hints at
what might be to come on future albums. Ms. Veirs is definitely not resting
on her laurels and hopefully will continue to evolve into deeper territory.
In my humble estimation she is one of the top songwriters working today,
she deserves more recognition.

But his ballads have missed the mark with listeners though than just being sensual. For his latest ballad, For The Rest Of My Life, the song isn't bad, but it doesn't feel like ignites to what Robin Thicke had done before with beautiful songs like Lost Without U, and The Sweetest Thing. It isn't a bad song, but not really anything that really is swooning about. Still Robin is definitely a better singer / songwriter than simply all the joke songs that radio has been displaying from artists like Beyonce' and Rihanna. I do hope though there will be a better ballad from Robin worth swooning to and say for the rest of our lives.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0108UP0EC,1,1,4,"I am not a huge fan of heavy metal, but honestly it is very surprising to take a spin of great covers. When I heard about Disturbed, I was not really a huge fan of their music, because it just didn't ignite with my own soul. But I have absolutely been a very huge fan of Simon & Garfunkel, and honestly they have written a great soundtrack for so many generations. So when I had that Disturbed was going to do a rendition of one of Paul and Art's classic songs, The Sound Of Silence, I was very skeptical to hear whether or not they could deliver, and honestly I was absolutely blown away. Disturbed's version of the classic song, The Sound Of Silence, is honestly one of the nicest surprises in music for the past several years at all. The intimacy of the orchestration into the heavy metal tone was really with a shock. I thought this version was really a dime in a dozen.  I sincerely recommend you download this song, and hear a new take on a Simon & Garfunkel classic.

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B0085LKYN4,1,1,4,"Curren$y would be considered a `veteran' (or semi-veteran) in the rap game considering the number of albums and mixtapes he has released over the year. 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stoned-Immaculate/dp/B007W1C5YE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stoned Immaculate</a>, despite his previous releases, is his debut effort on major label Warner Bros.  The results are nothing short of positive as the MC delivers strongly throughout the course of The Stoned Immaculate.  There are no overt misses, though the greatest cuts do overshadow the lesser ones.

""What It Look Like"" featuring Wale is a soulful, lush way to open the effort.  Lifting from the Philadelphia-soul driven production that made Wale's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ambition/dp/B005N9EXDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ambition</a>&nbsp;enjoyable, ""What It Look Like"" combines two MC's with solid skills that contrast each others respective styles.  Wale's flow is agile while Curren$y allows for his southern drawl and lazier style to `go to work.'  All is anchored in Wale's simple, though smart and addictive hook: ""Look, what it look like/ my n---s, fly n----s, this is Jet Life...""  ""Privacy Glass"" may have a hard act to follow, but gets the job done. Curren$y rolls solo this time, but rides the percussive beat and strings with ease. His flow is casual, but he sells this clever cut well - after all he ""...usually doesn't ride like this/privacy tinted, professionally driven.""

""Armoire"" features Young Roddy & Trademark providing the assist to Curren$y.  The production is a bit odd, but certainly enjoyable with its speaker-rattling bass. ""Armoire"" is not quite as elite as ""What It Look Like"" or ""Privacy Glass,"" but still above average.  Young Roddy & Trademark deliver a sound enough hook while Curren$y handles the verses.  ""Take You There"" featuring Marsha Ambrosius is produced by J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, who give off a `chill' sound.  Ambrosius vocals suit the cut, though she isn't given much chance to ad lib on the simple hook: ""Bright lights, big city/big cars...so baby you can roll with me/I'll show you how it's supposed to be."" While ""Take You There"" is good, it is not quite to the level of its predecessors.  ""Showroom"" also falls into this boat, delivering a sound cut, though not the `best of the best.'

""Capitol,"" featuring the up-and-coming 2 Chainz restores any conceded momentum or energy.  Both MC's deliver strong verses in this five-minute plus ditty, which features superb old-school, soulful production.  The production itself is mostly a loop with a mobile bass line that `shapes' the overall cut.  While minimal might be the approach, the end results are `excellence.'  The hook is none too shabby either: ""And my reputation precedes me, they already know/I keep it capital G apostrophe D/Going hard, making it look easy/Cause when I do what it do, I do it like I'm doing it for TV."" ""No Squares"" claims valedictory honors with its slow, grinding tempo and lazy, inherently southern production.  Wiz Khalifa guests here and proves the perfect collaborator for Curren$y - ""I'm rolling up an insane amount of smoke/diamonds all up in the chain around my throat..."" he boasts at the beginning of his verse.  The hook is killer: ""No square shall enter in the circle of winners... ain't been like none of them n---s as far as I can remember...""

""Sunroof,"" featuring Corner Boy P brings the effort back to earth after its lofty ascent, but still remains strong.  The use of 808 complements the other drum programming well here, adding some extra `punctuation.' ""Chasin' Papers"" `brings back' the swagger of ""No Squares"" delivering an odd-ball collaboration with Pharrell Williams (The Neptunes produce).  Pharrell's somewhat weak, though distinct voice works perfectly here to deliver one of the more left-brain hooks: ""I know I was there so I seen and did what you up to/I know you're chasing the paper/I know that you scared but it's there and the girls wanna [....] you/I know you're chasing that paper..""  Not to be outdone by Pharrell, Estelle delivers grace and excellence on the more romantic ""That's the Thing,"" in which she proudly sings ""...you're everything thing...see that's the thing, yea that's the thing..."" On the bridge, unlike with Marsha Ambrosius on ""Take You There,"" Estelle is given breathing room to `shine'.

""Chandelier"" features those good ole soulful, dusty beats and bass line, though at over five minutes unlike the other `fivers,' it lacks the substance to be as effective.  ""Fast Cars Faster Women"" featuring and produced by Daz Dillinger works well, with its soulful production.  Curren$y is definitely in his zone as is Dillinger's clearer, contrasting rap vocals on verse two.  The album ends with the Big K.R.I.T produced ""Jet Life,"" which possesses an old-school, southern hip-hop sound. It doesn't end the album with the zest that ""What It Look Like"" opens it with, but at this point, Curen$y has already proven himself.

A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B002L4U5RG,1,1,5,"""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" is one of the definitive songs of the 1980's.  Although they didn't write the song and were the fourth choice to record it,  Simple Minds transformed it into an anthem.  They perfectly captured the angst and self-absortion of the middle to upper class teen.  The opening riff and hey hey hey hey, ooh ooo start are instantly recognizable and iconic.  The song meshes seamlessly into what John Hughes was trying to capture on screen with The Breakfast Club and they permanently intertwined.  It is impossible to think of one without the other.  The song was a monster hit in the spring of 1985, going all the way to number one.",""" Do not You ( Forget About Me ) "" is one of the definitive songs of the 1980 's .

Where as the case with Pearl Jam & Nirvana being looked upon as music legends. But Chris Cornell did show a sincere voice with a very fragile heart at the soul. That is the case with some of Soundgarden's masterpieces, and Black Hole Sun has remained the Soundgarden opus that many fans will continue to come back to.

A29AQW33B8ILM1,B01DQ6ON70,1,-1,3,"Volbeat's sound is very recognizable, now more than ever thanks to heavy rotation on the radio. Songs like ""Heaven nor Hell"" and ""Lola Montez"" catapulted this group to mainstream status in a major way. However, they also seem to have resulted in less heavy riffs and more towards melodic hard rock. Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies was where this transformation really got started, even though the group has always had its share of melodic hard rock. There were generally more heavy riffs. Outlaws Gentlemen had some good riffs on tracks like ""Dead But Rising"", ""The Hangman's Body Count"", and ""Doc Holiday"", but in general was pretty much melodic hard rock. This album follows that trend, but even further in my opinion. Tracks such as ""The Devils Bleading Crown"" and ""The Loa's Crossroad""  bookend the disc on somewhat heavy notes, but everything in between is catchy melodic hard rock. Sadly this group is falling into Nickelback status with how formulated their albums are becoming. Their one saving grace is they aren't doing cheesy love songs. The riffs and vocals though are becoming too similar with each disc. I understand the ""if it's not broken, don't fix it"" mentality. It's worked for many mainstream bands, but it does wear thin on those who would like a bit more creativity. Not talking about reinvention or anything, because that often leads to even more backlash, but something to mix things up a bit would be nice in the furture.","Volbeat 's sound is very recognizable , now more than ever thanks to heavy rotation on the radio .

Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies was where this transformation really got started , even though the group has always had its share of melodic hard rock . Outlaws Gentlemen had some good riffs on tracks like "" Dead and "" Doc Holiday "" , but in general was pretty much melodic hard rock . Tracks such as "" The Devils Bleading Crown "" but everything in between is catchy melodic hard rock . Sadly this group is falling into Nickelback status with how formulated their albums are becoming . Their one saving grace is they are not doing cheesy love songs . I understand the "" if it is not broken , do not fix it "" mentality . It is worked for many mainstream bands , who would like a bit more creativity . because that often leads to even more backlash , that often leads to even more backlash , but something to mix things up a bit would be nice in the furture ."

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

With that said, I did pay for this this song.  If however, you are just looking to build a music library on a budget, I'd highly recommend checking out Amazon's free / cheap collection of music, featuring songs as well as albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B00BEBM9JY,1,-1,3,"For those who are unaware, Rodney Crowell used to be part of Emmylou Harris' Hot Band, way back in the mid-'70s.  Crowell went onto his own success as a songwriter and artist (and Rosanne Cash's first husband).

Fast forward 30-odd years later and Harris and Crowell have finally put out an album together, 'Old Yellow Moon'.  While it had been in the works for a while, it was finally released recently.  I was SO looking forward to this when I heard about it almost a year ago.

For all of Crowell's songwriting skills, only four of the dozen songs are his - the rest are covers from other artists, which is actually Harris' strength.

I really like both artists, so why am I not fully digging 'Old Yellow Moon'?  Was the anticipation too high?

There are some tunes are old country like, that both performed back in the day - and they can be good (""Chase the Feeling"", ""Invitation to the Blues"", ""Bluebird Wine"", ""Bull Rider"" and ""Open Season on My Heart""), but I would be hard pressed to say any were great.

Harris has some really good leads (""Spanish Dancer"").  Crowell does ok on a few.  Then there are some that should really work well and don't quite deliver (""Back When We Were Beautiful"").  And then there are one or two that just kind of drag down the disk (""Black Caffeine"" for example).

Harris still has an incredible voice and I like Crowell as a solo artist and as a songwriter and producer.  I'm not sure why he didn't produce this (or write more songs for this), as it was handled by Harris' ex-husband and the man who helmed a number of her disks in the '70s and '80s (and one or two of her last disks).

Perhaps the disk will grow on me, but I didn't get a great first or second impression.

A3CPA0XGKNY9ZJ,B00920DU6A,1,1,4,"Prime Cuts:  The Power of a Prayer, Hello My Name Is, Forgiveness

Quipped with memorable lines, stocked with engaging stories, and imbued with life transforming Biblical truths, these are ingredients that make these 12 new cuts from West's new CD so alluring.  After dabbling his toes last year in the festive waters with the release of his first ever Christmas release last year, ""Into the Light"" is West's newest effort following the hugely successful ""The Story of Your Life.""  Save for the title cut ""Into the Light"" being co-written by West and his producer Pete Kipley (Shane and Shane, Kutless and Mark Schultz), the entire album was written by West singlehandedly.  This shouldn't come as a surprise as West is one of the most sought after writers in Nashville, having written cuts for Rascal Flatts, Mandisa, Point of Grace, Billy Ray Cyrus, Natalie Grant and 33Miles.  And the sui genesis of this new studio album came out of the overflow of ""The Story of Your Life.""  Shortly after the release of ""Story,"" West collected over 10,000 personal stories from his fans and their struggles with God and the Christian faith.  Such narratives became the muses for his songs here.  West needs to be applauded for sermonising these testimonies for us in interweaving the penetrating pain, frustrations and disappointments of these protagonists with heart wrenching Scriptural truths and profoundly thought out faith statements.

Stylistically, West has not deviated from his serviceable pop grooves that made him (in many ways) Contemporary Christian music's equivalent to Jason Mraz or Gavin DeGraw.  Again this album is choke full songs of songs with soaring hooks including the lilting title cut ""Into the Light.""  With the repetitive chant ""Come on! Come On!"" inviting us to leave our sinful lives to follow after Christ's light, this is the Gospel call made irresistibly indelible.  Nestled in the soft stirring of strings, ""Forgiveness"" is a Godly response towards a lady by the name of Renee who lost her 20-year-old daughter when she was hit by a drunken driver.  Remember to keep some Kleenex at the side when West warmly nudges, ""So let it (the hurt) go and be amazed/By what you see through the eyes of grace/The prisoner that it really frees is you.""  Ultimately our pains can only be put down via the power of prayer, and this is the thesis for the piano based ballad ""The Power of a Prayer.""  Somehow one would wish West would somehow include more piano ballads as he truly does them with utmost beauty.

West is not afraid to be creative in his story telling.  Somehow reminding us of the Biblical story of Job where Job would quiz God about his sufferings, ""Moved by Mercy"" finds West and Caitlin Evanson treading lines in an imagery question and response between God and a fellow sufferer.  While the perennial struggle of listening to voices of regret and defeat over anchoring our identity in Christ is the theme of the invigorating ""Hello My Name Is.""  The crisp guitars, the assertive piano chops and the gutsy lyrics certainly make this one of West's ever cuts.  ""Do Something"" is a Godly kick in the face of any couch potato complainer who is frustrated that God has done enough for humanity when we ourselves would not ""do something"" for His Kingdom.  Despite the rollicking fun in this track, it never should crib us from the theological truth that we are God's change agents.

With his high energy performance and the propulsive nature of these pop songs, by the middle of the album one would wish for a quieter (or at least a different) change of pace.  Though there's diversity in the stories and lyrics, some of the melodies tend to sound similar and tiresome especially towards the latter half of the disc.  Maybe some variation in production or one or two outside songs might easily simply elevate this problem.  Other than this quibble, ""Into the Light"" is one of West's best records to date.  West never hides away from the brokenness of sin.  But it's in the valley of our hurts, West brings us via these songs to appreciate how beautiful and high the mountains of God's love are.","Prime Cuts :   The Power of a Prayer , Hello My Name Is , Forgiveness

"" Save for the title cut "" Into the Light "" being co - written by West This should not come as a surprise as West is one of the most sought after writers in Nashville , having written cuts for Rascal Flatts , Mandisa , Point of Grace , Billy Ray Cyrus , Natalie Grant Shortly after the release of "" Story , "" West collected over 10,000 personal stories from his fans and their struggles with God and the Christian faith . West needs to be applauded for sermonising these testimonies for us in interweaving the penetrating pain , frustrations and disappointments of these protagonists with heart wrenching Scriptural truths and profoundly thought out faith statements . Again this album is choke full songs of songs with soaring hooks including the lilting title cut "" Into the Light . "" With the repetitive chant "" Come on ! Come On ! "" inviting us to leave our sinful lives to follow after Christ 's light , this is the Gospel call made irresistibly indelible . Nestled in the soft stirring of strings , "" Forgiveness "" is a Godly response towards a lady by the name of Renee who lost her 20 - year - old daughter when she was hit by a drunken driver . when West warmly nudges , "" So let it ( the hurt ) go and be amazed / By what you see through the eyes of grace / The prisoner that it really frees is you . "" Ultimately our pains can only be put down via the power of prayer , Somehow one would wish West would somehow include more piano ballads as he truly does them with utmost beauty . West is not afraid to be creative in his story telling . where Job would quiz God about his sufferings , "" Moved by Mercy "" finds West and response between God and a fellow sufferer . While the perennial struggle of listening to voices of regret and defeat over anchoring our identity in Christ is the theme of the invigorating "" Hello My Name Is . "" The crisp guitars , the assertive piano chops and the gutsy lyrics certainly make this one of West 's ever cuts . "" Do Something "" is a Godly kick in the face of any couch potato complainer who is frustrated that God has done enough for humanity Despite the rollicking fun in this track , it never should crib us from the theological truth that we are God 's change agents . With his high energy performance and the propulsive nature of these pop songs , by the middle of the album one would wish for a quieter ( and tiresome especially towards the latter half of the disc . or two outside songs might easily simply elevate this problem . Other than this quibble , "" Into the Light "" is one of West 's best records to date . West never hides away from the brokenness of sin . But it is in the valley of our hurts , West brings us via these songs to appreciate how beautiful and high the mountains of God 's love are ."

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.","that said , I could explain all the reasons I love this , that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool , It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides Granted it is only a 30 second sample , but that is generally enough time to explore new bands that is generally enough time to explore new bands or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version .

APH47HG47SJ64,B0042HQBQ4,1,1,5,"Read my other reviews and you'll notice a pattern. I'll let everyone else debate the merits of the album. This review is for those eager to buy the album but are still deciding about know which version to get.

DOWNLOAD Versus CD? - Depends on sale price
If the download is still sale priced at or below five clams when you see this AND you're just a casual fan - I'd go download. It's an incredible deal. Sonically, there's not much a difference in sound the way this album is mixed.

CD Versus Deluxe CD?
The one thing the regular edition of the CD has going for it is the traditional jewel case. An easier to access CD and a booklet that won't get worn down too easily. The Deluxe edition is in an annoying DigiPak - the type where you need to seriously wrestle with it to remove the disc without snapping it in half. Once I liberated mine, I re-housed it in a regular slimline case. The colorful booklet is stitched into the digipak case, which looks lovely, but needs to be handled with white gloves to preserve it's condition. In an odd move, the side pocket that could have housed the CD (preferred) or booklet is instead stuffed with a 2-sided mini poster. Clearly, they are going after the tween girl demographic with this move, but if my phantom baby daughter tucked a poster of a 30-year old man in her locker, I would buy her some Bieber stat.

The main reason to go Deluxe is the 4 bonus tracks. You get ""The Clock Was Ticking"" - a Grand Ole Opry country romp that also recalls the lyrical pace of The Nails' ""88 Lines for 44 Women"" and Jim Carrol's ""People Who Died."" ""Jacksonville"" is an album highlight - a trippy number with a slinky beat and a chilling woven bass guitar line. ""I Came Here To Get Over You"" almost sounds like a great lost Weezer song and ""Right Behind You"" brings the album to a proper close with heavy wet synths.

Overall - this album, even more than the b-sides comp ""Sawdust"" feels like a full-fledged Killers album. I recently bought solo outings from Paul Banks (Interpol) and Julian Casablancas (The Strokes) - both tread new territory, but were so sterile they left me little inspiration for repeat listens. Flamingo is much more warm and inviting, like Las Vegas luring headlights down Highway 15 in the dead of night.","I will let everyone else debate the merits of the album .

A11F8B8GQURI84,B00136LECS,1,1,4,"A radio station that I used to listen to in Tampa would play nothing but Christmas music from the day after Thanksgiving until December 26. This was one of their Christmas songs. The song tells a story about the singer meeting an old lover at a record store. The story takes place at Christmas time but otherwise has absolutely nothing to do with Christmas! This song has more to do with regrets over missed opportunities. I like it, but Dan Fogelberg has done better songs.

A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00122X3HW,-1,-1,3,"Issued in 1980, Cheech & Chong's LET'S MAKE A NEW OPE DEAL (HS 3391) was their sixth of seven comedy albums and the first for WARNER BROS. Records. Audio quality is improved over their ODE LPs, with some nifty studio effects added, but the material isn't as strong as on their '70s releases. Side One is a suite of related tracks.

""SIDE"" NOTES --

When I was a college senior in 1981, literally everyone was singing it. The Japanese riff refrain is very catchy and as if that's not enough, it causes plenty of spicy talk about what it means to say one is turning Japanese. I can't explain that any further in this review so you will have to do your own research but suffice it to say that you need this song at your next retro New Age party.

On this second studio effort Nikki reunites with lead guitarist James Michael and lead singer DJ Ashba who also handles keyboards, drums and programming.  With a stable line up you can rightfully expect the same musical recipe of the debut. For that matter you get a rather modern version of Sleaze metal emphasizing instrumental melodies and vocal harmonies with intriguing arrangements, often adding orchestral parts, acoustic backing instruments and piano. Above all, the end result is incredibly catchy, offering some of the most memorable hooks. Favourite tracks include ""Help is on the way"", ""This is gonna hurt"", ""Lies of the beautiful people"", ""Live forever"" and ""Goodbye my dear friends"".

Indeed ""This is gonna hurt"" is another well arranged offering from Sixx's band that definitely stands on its own regardless of whether the listener has actually read the book counterpart. Each song has such a developed musical personality standing differentiated from the rest and it is this quality that makes the album an enjoyably listen from start to finish; perhaps making one wish that the band included more songs on it. ""This is gonna hurt"" is a must for any fan of Sleaze metal, ""Motley Crue"", ""Bad City"" or ""Black veil Brides"".",""" This is going to hurt "" is the second , brand new album by "" Sixx A.M.

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

I find it more polished, (by that I mean a more mature and well thought out record) than their first. For vinyl lovers, we get clear vinyl and for all lovers of great music, we get much better sonics on ""Beneath The Skin"". (While I really liked ""My Head Is An Animal"", it didn't see a lot of playing time on my TT because of the sonics, which I found to be grating).

There's something about OMAM that has always reminded me of Sinead O'Connor in that I feel a positive sense of urgency along with a certain intensity this music brings in that same positive manner. I'm saying that after listening to (BTS), I want to go out and conquer the world or at the very least do very good things for my fellow man.  I find it to be most enjoyable and I'm left wanting more!

As of now, for my top picks in 2015, this lp and Death Cab's ""Kintsugi"" are my two favorites for music and sonics.

A1S2IY37JU93XS,B001IQMCZQ,1,-1,3,"Ever since the release of the ultra-successful The Emancipation of MiMi, by Mariah Carey, it seems as though record labels are constantly overthinking things in order to get hits, especially when they have an artist who is truly talented on their hands, like Jennifer Hudson. That would probably explain why the best song Jennifer Hudson has ever recorded, the lovely ""Stand Up,"" is nowhere to be found here. Quite honestly, this is not the classic album I was expecting from such a talented woman. Still, there are some nice songs. ""Spotlight"" is probably the best thing on here; it's light, but forceful, and its sparse production leaves ample room for Jennifer's powerful and emtional vocal delivery. The Timbaland-produced ""Pocketbook"" is pretty much the only moment on the album where she doesn't take herself so seriously, which makes it refreshing. It's sassy and silly (""don't make me hit you with my pocketbook""), but the track is almost ruined by Ludacris' unnecessarily nasty rap. The Robin Thicke-penned ""Giving Myself,"" a simple and beautiful ballad, was a nice choice. The piano-laden ""My Heart"" is very catchy and an overall nice mid-tempo. ""I'm His Only Woman,"" a duet with Fantasia, pays homage to Stax-era soul. ""We Gon' Fight"" is standard Tank fare, but it's enjoyable. And the closer, a rendition of the gospel traditional ""Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There,"" shows her vocals at their best. The rest of the songs, I'm afraid, are anything but satisfying and many of them are extremely trendy, meaning that there are songs all across the radio that sound similar. Luckily, Hudson's voice elevates all of these from being embarrassingly bad, except on the biggest monstrosity: the duet with... T-Pain, ""What's Wrong (Go Away)."" 'Nuff said, it's inexcusible. ""If This Isn't Love"" is a bit too pop for my tastes. I can't believe artists are still calling up Diane Warren for songs, because in my opinion, she was finished almost a decade ago. Anyways, her addition, ""You Pulled me Through"" is pretty uninspiring. ""Can't Stop the Rain"" has a generally nice melody and has touching lyrics, but the production is very stale. ""Invisible"" isn't very exciting, either, and the chorus is too dramatic. And the inclusion of ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"" was pretty unnecessary in my eyes, especially since I--and probably the rest of America--had grown tired of it by the time the Academy Awards came around. Contrary to what other reviewers are saying, ""All Dressed Up In Love"" is not included as a bonus track on the standard edition. As I said before, all this material is made better due to the simple fact that it's Jennifer Hudson singing, and there are six or seven good tracks. But there are just as many songs that should've been left off, and with over 40 tracks recorded for this album, you'd think Hudson and Clive Davis could've formulated a great tracklist. If you want an excellent new female R&B album, buy Jazmine Sullivan's Fearless, because this just isn't cutting it for me. Maybe next time.","Ever since the release of the ultra - successful The Emancipation of MiMi , by Mariah Carey , it seems as though record labels are constantly overthinking things in order to get hits , especially who is truly talented on their hands , like Jennifer Hudson . why the best song Jennifer Hudson has ever recorded , the lovely "" Stand Up , "" is nowhere to be found here .

A2VHYWSV7ZLZOV,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5,"Ah, the Supreme Warbler!  She is to popular music what Florence Foster Jenkins was to classical.  Were they parody?  Or unfortunate victims of a cruel and greedy commercial machine that used them up like oil and spat them out when they were spent?  There were, after all, musical satirists like Anna Russell and much later, The Bonzo Dog Band and Monty Python, who reeked havoc with their sonic exploits, and made pots of money doing it, too.  But they knew exactly what they were doing.  What about Mrs. Miller?

Jonathan & Darlene Edwards came along years before Mrs. Miller, but I only discovered them many years after I fell in love with Mrs. Miller.  The former act was, in case some readers don't know it already, a gifted piano player/bandleader Paul Weston, and a supreme vocal stylist known in popular vocalist circles as a singer's singer, Jo Stafford.  She eventually became Weston's wife.  They were best known as themselves, but forged a separate career in musical parody.  What made me convulse with laughter when I was in the mood to listen to these two cutting up vinyl was the knowledge that bad singing isn't easy, and Jo did it by singing sharp.  Try it.  It's harder than singing flat; believe me (and sounds even more horrible).  Now, you may be asking, what do Jonathan and Darlene Edwards have to do with Mrs. Miller?  For me, it's personal, but it may help me to explain the appeal of Mrs. Miller to so many people.

I tried to introduce a foreign-born coworker in an office where I worked to Jonathan and Darlene.  He would have none of it.  He said, ""she's doing that deliberately; that's not funny.""  You see I had previously turned him on to the giddy delights of Mrs. Miller.  In prying my friend for answers as to why he found Jonathan and Darlene NOT funny, and Mrs. Miller roll-on-the-floor hysterical, I got an unexpected response.  No, he said Mrs. Miller is like your grandmother singing your favorite popular songs to you, and maybe even some songs you hate.  Somehow, she's innocent, charming, and yes, very, very funny.  Whatever the True story, and you'll read of several in these Amazon reviews, what the person called Mrs. Miller left us was a small body of crystalline comedic treasures.  She may or may not have been exploited, or she may have exploited herself, but she was an otherwise nobody who became immortal.

Just listen to these miracles of concise humor and comic mistiming.  How can you not laugh and love this woman all at the same time?  And face it, who's gonna take ""Sweet Pea,"" ""Catch A Falling Star"" and ""I've Got A Tiger By the Tail"" seriously, anyway?  This music was ripe for a little destructive reinterpreting.  And her ""Boots?""  Sorry, Nancy, Mrs. Miller's is The Definitive Version.

My one, small criticism of this nearly complete compilation is the omission of ""Up, Up And Away.""  Talk about Definitive! (If you're a Mrs. Miller fan already, and haven't heard ""Up, Up and Away,"" you owe it to yourself to hunt down this delightful rarity). But perhaps the best moment on this particular collection is when Mrs. Miller hits that high note in ""Lover's Concerto.""  She NAILS it!  And people said she couldn't sing!

I think Jonathan and Darlene Edwards had the harder task, both musically, and as comedians, but they could always have the perspective in life that they had a goof, enjoyed it, made some money, and did it with purpose; you can even hear them winking in their recordings.  I do think they are funny, but in a very different way from how Mrs. Miller is funny.  My coworker was right about one thing:  Mrs. Miller was Grandma.  And you might laugh WITH her and even AT her when her back was turned, but never would you sneer at her face to face.  No, you want to give her a hug, because somehow these crazy, one-of-a-kind creations exemplify the best that comedy has to offer.  I completely disagree with those who say that laughing at Mrs. Miller's music is cruel.  I think Mrs. Miller might have understood, had she lived to witness her digital revival, that she had created something entertaining and unique, even if it wasn't taken as she had intended.  Nothing to be ashamed of there, and if her life was in some ways tragic, its legacy is not the least bit sad.","Ah , the Supreme Warbler !

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B002QUPD04,1,1,5,"There's no doubt in my mind that David Archuleta has lots of professional talent and this album stuns me with its high quality control holiday music; David never misses a beat and that's wonderful. David really poured his heart and soul into this holiday album and it's very clear when I listen to this; his ability to sing and express the complete range of human emotions is outstanding. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like the artwork as well.

The album starts with ""Joy to the World;"" David sings this with panache and the arrangement plays with the tempo and the keys to let David put his own stamp on this classic ballad! He also really opens up and sings those lyrics with a voice that sounds like that of a much more seasoned entertainer; his talent is quite natural and he also has the ability to go much, much further in his chosen profession which is truly exciting. ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" has a lush musical arrangement and David makes this shine with his fantastic singing. ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" has always been a favorite holiday tune of mine; David Archuleta performs this with panache and he never lets go of a single superfluous note! I love it.

""Silent Night"" gets a most sensitive treatment from David who delivers this to perfection--and beyond! ""Silent Night"" is definitely a highlight of this album; and listen for David to do a superb job on ""The First Noel."" ""The First Noel"" charms me with its natural beauty and David's voice sounds like a finely tuned instrument as he sings this faultlessly.

Charice Pempengco joins David for ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas;"" this was first performed by Judy Garland in ""Meet Me in Saint Louis."" David and Charice make this ballad an outstanding highlight of the album. The somewhat jazzy arrangement fits perfectly with their vocals and I really like their rendition of ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" It's heaven.

""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" was my mother's favorite holiday song; and David does this justice! He sings this passionately and you can tell he really means it from his heart when you hear him on this track. ""Pat-A-Pan"" is thrown in for a good effect; David performs this very well and it's a good number. ""What Child Is This"" is another charmer that David aces as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing--but of course we know that it really wasn't all that easy. David's talent carries him through.

""Ave Maria"" sounds just perfect; and the album ends so well with David Archuleta performing ""Melodies of Christmas."" ""Melodies of Christmas"" is a strong ending number for the album and it certainly leaves me wanting more!

David Archuleta delivers on this holiday album and I'm fantastically impressed. This is a must-have for David's fans and it makes a great CD to add to any holiday music collection.","There is no doubt in my mind that David Archuleta has lots of professional talent and this album stuns me with its high quality control holiday music ; David never misses a beat and that is wonderful . that is wonderful . and soul into this holiday album and it is very clear when I listen to this ; his ability to sing and express the complete range of human emotions is outstanding . The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like the artwork as well . The album starts with "" Joy to the World ; "" David sings this with panache and the arrangement plays with the tempo and the keys to let David put his own stamp on this classic ballad ! that sounds like that of a much more seasoned entertainer ; his talent is quite natural and he also has the ability to go much , much further in his chosen profession which is truly exciting . "" Angels We Have Heard on High "" has a lush musical arrangement and David makes this shine with his fantastic singing . "" O Come All Ye Faithful "" has always been a favorite holiday tune of mine ; David Archuleta performs this with panache and he never let us go of a single superfluous note ! I love it . "" Silent Night "" gets a most sensitive treatment from David who delivers this to perfection -- "" Silent Night "" is definitely a highlight of this album ; and listen for David to do a superb job on "" The First Noel . "" "" The First Noel "" charms me with its natural beauty and David 's voice sounds like a finely tuned instrument as he sings this faultlessly .

AZSN1TO0JI87B,B014ELDZM0,1,1,5,"When the members of Baroness were involved in a serious tour bus accident in 2012, it seemed like music would be the least of their concerns for a while. Though everyone walked away to live another day, it was less than a year later that the rhythm section of Allen Blickle (drums) and Matt Maggioni (bass) would walk away from the band altogether. But just as time heals all wounds, so too does music. The remaining core members, John Baizley (vocals, guitar) and Peter Adams (guitar, back-up vocals) vowed to carry on and in doing so, hunkered down with a new line-up of musicians to create a very personal comeback album.

In that spirit, ""Purple"" is indeed a re-birth for the band. While it still sounds unmistakingly Baroness-ish, there's a newfound sense of confidence and directness to the music that even the lofty heights of 2012's ambitious double album, ""Yellow & Green"" didn't quite capture, even if the band's full capabilities aren't fully explored. Truth be told, ""Purple"" sounds like the it belongs right in the middle of ""Blue"" (their transitionary record) and ""Yellow & Green"" (their real breakthrough), and that's not a bad place to be.

Injecting a bit more ruggedness into his delivery than on the last album, Baizley is at his most passionate and urgent and thankfully, the band -- rounded out by newcomers Nick Jost (bass) and Sebastian Thomson (drums) -- are more than up to the task. The album opens with the blistering ""Morningstar,"" bringing the band back to its roots. With this sludgy and complex slab of heavy rock, the tone for the rest of the album is set. The pace keeps chugging along with the emotionally charged ""Shock Me,"" a strong contender for the most powerful rock single released this (past) year. From there it gets a little spacier, with ""Try To Disappear"" starting with some sparse electronics and vocals that sound as if they were recorded underwater before rushing to the surface mid-way to show off an explosive rhythm section. The weight of the album culminates in its closing number, ""If I Have to Wake Up (Would You Stop the Rain?),"" a haunting semi-ballad sums up the album and the band's experiences over the past three years in a nice and neat bow. With only nine proper tracks, ""Purple"" packs quite a wallop in such a short amount of time.

The part about ""Purple"" that may bruise the Baroness faithful is the fact that the album does little to push the band's evolution. It's really just a powerful re-affirmation and a slight return to form for those who may have felt they went off the deep end a little on their last album. To that end, it's certainly a satisfying listen even if it doesn't quite break new ground. The streamlined delivery (not to mention the running time clocking in at just over 40 minutes) makes it a powerful and potent experience all its own. Considering these guys could very well have quit music altogether after all they have experienced these last couple of years, it's a miracle that they are still standing and still sounding this good. Here's hoping they keep it just as colorful from here on out.","When the members of Baroness were involved in a serious tour bus accident in 2012 , it seemed like music would be the least of their concerns for a while .

ALD1CRUBY1365,B0070LQJ7U,1,1,4,"For example, after ""Heaven & Earth"" Came out. I've been a Yes fan since their ""Yes Album"" after I'd dismissed the single ""Your Move"" as generic folk pop. But then I bought the next album ""Fragile"", which prompted a second look at the previous release ""The Yes Album"". Once ""Yours Is No Disgrace"" started, with it's opening trio riff between Bruford, Howe and Squire reminded me of the theme from the film ""Magnificent Seven"" by way of old ""Marlboro Country"" TV ads, I was hooked. So for one album to prompt me regarding an earlier album is history repeating itself. At first I was underwhelmed by the title suite of this album ""Fly From Here"" because it comes across as a medley rather than an epic. I know that other tracks this long have multiple themes within them, but this one is physically split into individual tracks. Which doesn't work well on an MP3 player because there's this hiccup between tracks that fortunately doesn't show on the CD. But the recurring theme is so like Yes, except this one sounds like Squire wrote it. He's always been the one to fool with eccentric time signatures (""The Fish"" from ""Fragile"" with its 7/4 beat). Only this riff is in 5/4. Another song perhaps has Squire on lead vocals is the next track ""The Man You've Always Wanted Me To Be"". I can't tell whether it's Chris or if Trevor Horn did a cameo here--both are in that same tenor that kept Horn's voice from ""working"" on ""Drama"".","For example , after "" Heaven & Earth "" Came out .

A92F571Y9MTW6,B00SYTTBMC,1,1,5,"The state of Alabama has long been known as a hotbed of musical talent. It's also been known for the city of Muscle Shoals- which housed a recording studio that housed some of the biggest names from the 1960's up to the 1980's. Though most of Alabama's talent tend to lend more toward country and R&B, the state has brought us some familiar names within the last decade. In recent years, there's been three American Idol contestants (Ruben Studdard, Bo Bice, Taylor Hicks), Brent Hinds of the heavy metal act Mastodon and the Athens quartet Alabama Shakes. The quartet is fronted by lead singer and primary songwriter Brittany Howard- whose voice owes a huge debt to singers like Janis Joplin and Genya Ravan. The remaining members are bassist Zac Cockrell, drummer Steve Johnson and guitarist Heath Fogg. The origins of Alabama Shakes started in high school when two of the members started writing songs together in high school. One member was asked to join while working at a local music store and the other joined after hearing their demo. After working with a local record producer, they released an EP, played at a festival and was given a recording contract all within the span of a year.

They released their debut ""Boys & Girls"" in Spring 2012 on Dave Matthews' label ATO Records. The recording received rave reviews and even earned the band a Gold certification from the RIAA. Exactly three years after their debut, the band released their sophomore effort  ""Sound & Color"". Though they felt at home with in their Stax Records influenced music, they decided to take things in a different direction this time around. Musically, they've added keyboards and vibraphones, but still remain True to their sound. They also took a  more direct approach to making a radio friendly record, which actually sounds better than their debut. The album opens with the title track ""Sound & Color"", where they are content with having a peace of mind. On the uptempo ""Don't Wanna Fight"", the song centers around a woman who wants to extend an olive branch to her partner to avoid their constant bickering. They think about the deceased on ""Future People"", while Brittany sings of wanting to love someone dealing with personal issues on the first single ""Gimme All Your Love"". They are content with having an ally on ""This Feeling"", while being unsure about her feelings toward an ex on the ballad ""Miss You"". Being optimistic toward a new relationship is the theme of the song ""Gemini"", while they end the album with the ambient ballad ""Over My Head"". ""Sound & Color"" is a great album by Alabama Shakes. Though it's radically different from its predecessor, it's a step forward from a band that seems to like making music their way. With that frame of mind, expect to hear more great things from them in the near future.","The state of Alabama has long been known as a hotbed of musical talent .

How did I find it? I stumbled across two covers of this song, one by Carlos Santana and Steve Winwood on YouTube. I knew it had been done by someone else, so I went searching here at Amazon. Then I stumbled upon Sade's version. All three are good, and perhaps Sade's version is best, but the original by Timmy Thomas is the one you want, then the others too. GET IT if you remember it from the late 60s! It is the precursor to Marvin Gaye's album ""What's Going On"".","I had completely forgotten this song , but knew something like this existed .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00EW0VRQ0,-1,-1,2,"When a new artist comes out with a song, she has to really drive into her first song. For Sevyn Streeter who sung back on Chris Brown's big hit She Ain't You, which worked very well for him, she has to have a song make it on her own and work brilliantly. Her debut single, It Won't Stop from her first record Call Me Crazy, But.. isn't actually a strong song from her voice alone. I really found it more drowned out from her, because Chris Brown's voice overpowers the song so much, that it feels more like her sonnets are robotic and not as strong. Does the strong work, well it would work more from her if she was going to bring more from her voice and heart. She might sound sensual in the beat, but Sevyn doesn't at all. Hopefully, with her net set of songs there will be better from her to match and beyond, than she could say It Won't Stop.

He showed that a few years ago with Not Afraid from his Recovery album, and he did show that earlier this year with Bezerk song from his Marshall Mathers EP 2 earlier this year. But just cause you have one great song, that doesn't mean the next one will be just as dominant. Rap God, the second single from The Marshall Mathers EP 2 isn't actually as well-written or enjoyable as was the case with Bezerk.

Jess has a wonderful voice, and I love the finger shaking that she and the other people do in the accompanying music video -- which looks like it was either shot in Kyoto or Tokyo, Japan.

Other few and far between artists have been successful in combining 2 opposite, polarizing brands of music, such as fellow electric violinist Vanessa Mae.

A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"It is a myth that soul was a singles medium. At least half a myth. In the 1960s, it was True. Most Motown albums were not meant to hold together as such. But when Stevie Wonder released Music Of My Mind in early 1972, he proved soul LPs could work as cohesively as any rock LP.

And so it went for Gamble and Huff and Thom Bell, the Philly Sound. Both the O'Jays with Back Stabbers and here, this first Spinners album, are just that: albums. Playing the singles on AM was AM's gain and lack of FM airplay was FMs loss.

The Spinners, the album, does not have a concept like the O'Jays Back Stabbers or Ship Ahoy.  Or does it? If love and passion can be a concept, it is best illustrated on this album

There is the Philly Sound, there is........well, easy there, let's climb one mountain at a time.  The lush horns, strings, vibes, and master vocals are wound into one massive, wonderful silk sheet of sound. I don't have to tell you, just listen. Wagner would be proud

""I'll Be Around,"" ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love,"" ""One Of A Kind Love Affair."" Anyone born by 1970 or before grew up hearing these on the radio, and do you believe how stupid some of us were? We heard this music next to Daddy Dewdrop's ""Chick-A-Boom,"" or ""Have You Ever Been Mellow,"" by Oliva Newton John, and quickly ran to our King Crimson albums, unable to separate the prime rib from the beef jerky. The best soul from the worst pop. We look at ourselves now. Wagner would NOT approve.

More proof. Yeah, sure. Play part of Coltrane's Love Supreme next to Bobby Goldsboro's ""Honey,"" and run for the hills. The blimp has crashed. But take said 'Trane and then go into ""One Of A Kind Love Affair,"" and it will be the start of a one of a kind love affair--for you. Me too.

Talking jazz,  I almost forgot. There is jazz here, too. Check out the third track, ""Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You"" I needn't go into this, but it proves my point. All this wonderful music is wonderful music, some of which happened to be singles. But listen to The Spinners from start to end, like a stranger to this music, and all the richness and craft and variation, and there is a ton, holds together musically and conceptually.

What an  ALBUM","It is a myth At least half a myth In the 1960s , it was True . when Stevie Wonder released Music Of My Mind in early 1972 , he proved soul LPs could work as cohesively as any rock LP .

A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO,B000V6577O,1,1,5,"Wow!  There's sooooo... much to like in this album it's amazing.  The music is mostly upbeat & very catchy--making you want to (& will if no one's around) sing along.  The lyrics are fine, meaningful, & personally touching--about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world, while people are still people with hopes, feelings, needs, desires, & all the rest of what makes people human.  The lead singer, Jennifer Nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice (though a bit twangy in style).  She grabs you quickly for a wild ride--immersing the listener in the musical story she's telling.  I bought the CD based on hearing Baby Girl & Something More (on the TV show Vegas of all place).  Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA show--winning awards as they so deserve.  The range & variety of the songs on the album are good too--from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring.  Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles.  Yes, the style is their own mixture of influences--the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds, which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive.  And, the trio wrote all the songs on the CD--with Hall the primary author (solo writer on one of them).  How many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man?  I wonder if they are unique?  Well, they are unique even if not in that respect--how many bands include a mandolin?.  Of course, country purists may not be happy with them, but the vast majority of listeners ARE.  This has become one of my favorite albums, at the speed of sound.  IMHO, it's terrific.","Wow ! There is sooooo ... much to like in this album it is amazing .

The only downside is that there aren't any songs from Axis.., although the liner notes speculate that Jimi may have performed some of these tracks a the following day, but the show was cancelled because of rain.

I really like the song  ""Alice In Hulaland"". The steel pedal guitar gives this song a laid back Hawaiian music tone that I enjoy.  ""Django and Jimmie"" is a tribute song to two early 20th century musicians.  Django was a guitarist who inspired Willie Nelson. Jimmie Rodgers was an expert yodeler who inspired Merle Haggard to sing.  It is great to hear the about the musical influences of these legends in a song. ""Good Ol Johnny Cash"" is another tribute song to a music legend.  I don't mind tribute songs if they are either touching or humorous.  This song about Johnny Cash is.  I love the piano playing on the song  ""Family Bible."" I love the lyrics, even though I haven't read the Bible that much in my life.  I like the sentiment of a family sitting down to listen to a father read from the Bible. The coziness of a bar is captured in the song ""Swinging Doors"".  This is a great country song.

Holes in the Floor of Heaven

By Steve Wariner

One day shy of eight years old,
When grandma passed away.
I was a broken hearted little boy,
Blowing out that birthday cake.
How I cried when the sky let go,
With a cold lonesome rain.
My mom smiled, said: ""Don't be sad child.
""Grandma's watching you today.""

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.
""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.
""There's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Seasons come and seasons go,
Nothing stays the same.
I grew up, fell in love,
Met a girl who took my name.
Year by year, we made a life,
In this sleepy little town.
I thought we'd grow old together,
Lord, I sure do miss her now.

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.
""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.
""There's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Well my little girl is 23,
I walk her down the aisle.
It's a shame her Mom can't be here now,
To see her lovely smile.
They throw the rice, I catch her eye,
As the rain starts coming down.
She takes my hand; says: ""Daddy don't be sad,
'cause I know Mama's watching now.""

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.
""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.
""There's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Watching over you and me.

Watching over you and me.

Watching over you and me.","This is a beautiful song about our loved one and dealing with such a loss . Holes in the Floor of Heaven

While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD, including an energetic ""90 Degrees and Freezing"", a Motown-inspired, horn driven ""Come to Me Do"" and a catchy and powerful pop gem ""Feel"" (all penned by all-time great songwriter Robert Lamm), the record suffers from an over-abundance of ballads and sorry, over-blown production. I'm not a producer, but I know what sounds good to my ears.
I have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album, but the ones on this Chicago album, the first recording of all-original material in 15 years, are simply not good, whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint. I won't go down the list, but will cite ""King of Might Have Been"" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range.
I don't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD, but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band, Rascal Flatts. No more to say as this speaks for itself.  As confirmed by the band, DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording, and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on ""XXX"". Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop/rock/R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings, a CD of Chicago-only songs would, undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on ""XXX"".
Finally, DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members, thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance.
""Chicago XXX"" ""could have been a contender"" with a different approach to the CD's production.  We'll just have to wait for ""Chicago XXXI"".","For such a "" much anticipated "" return to the recording studio by this legendary superband which dominated the radio in the 70 's which dominated the radio in the 70 's and 80 's , this effort falls short of expectations .

The song is honestly very catchy after awhile. The song reminds me of how quirky Jason Mraz was when he broke out into the mainstream with The Remedy several years ago.

A14W1VNMMYLWND,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"1972 and 1973 were the years that the Spinners finally got the chance to breakthrough to a wide audience after years on Motown without any huge success.  Now with producer/writer team Thom Bell/Linda Creed, and a deal on Atlantic, they Spinners' hard work finally paid off after years.  This joint is surely a winner, with some heavy hitting mid-tempo soul jams.  This one contains some legendary jams like the rolling funk of ""I'll Be Around"" and ""Could It Be I'm Falling in Love"" heavily laden with strings, a staple of Philly Soul.  ""I'll Be Around"" is one of my favorite soul jams of all time, and even though I am 10 years younger than the song is, I remember listening to it and loving it in junior high school (in the mid 90's) when L.A. hip-hop station Power 106 FM had time set aside time for old school jams.  Rapper Rappin' 4-Tay also made his own version of it in 1994, a wonderful hip-hop jam which took the funky rolling music and some of the hook vocals for the rap song.  Another one of my favorites here is ""Just Me and You Baby,"" a slower, ballad type jam with heavenly harmony.  ""Ghetto Child"" is heavy mid-tempo jam exploring the bad side of growing up in the `hood, very sad and timeless.  ""How Could I Let You Get Away"" is a sadder lyrically rich song laden with sitars later in the song.  Phillipe Wynne, Bobbie Smith (great singers), and company surely deliver a rich album full of lush Thom Bell production and sweet harmony and melody; the transition from Detroit to Philly surely was a lucrative one.  1974's Mighty Love is another wonderful soulful album as is 1975's Pick of the Litter.  The Spinners are definitely essential listening in order to truly experience what Philly Soul has to offer.","that the Spinners finally got the chance to breakthrough to a wide audience after years on Motown without any huge success . and a deal on Atlantic , they Spinners ' hard work finally paid off after years .

A1TIASWAR8SPLC,B0042H8ALI,1,1,5,"It may sound odd, but, the main reason I purchased the entire album and not individual songs, as I usually do, is that the production quality on this album is AMAZING.  Every song is a pleasure to listen to through headphones - the instruments are all beautifully arranged in the mix and the sound just fills your ears in the most natural, gorgeous way.  A big reason for this, I believe, is the fact that acoustic instruments are used over synthesized and it makes all the difference.  The lyrics are outstanding & I love the somewhat dark & brooding nature of most of the songs.  The drums are out of this world good and every beat is crystal clear without overwhelming the mix - kudos to the producers & engineers who did such an excellent job.  I wish production value were as good on more artist's albums, but sadly, most of it today just stinks.","It may sound odd , that the production quality on this album is AMAZING .

I am really not into disco music but there is something about Donna Summer that bring out your inner love for disco. I will be honest she and the Bee Gees are the only ones from the disco era I care to listen to. The one thing about Donna Summer, to me she just isn't considered disco but also pop. Just like the Bee Gees I guess. I love a lot of her music, but this song is one of her best. I love the lyrics and the background music is killer. I recently heard it watching America Hustle; and was stoked. She, like Micheal Jackson will last forever, music wise. This song is great for anybody who likes old school tunes this is a downloader; and for you newbies listen to the sample on Amazon, you will love the beat.

A1A2AZP3H15UZ2,B0013D6O6M,-1,-1,1,"Evidently the title ""Simple Plan"" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, ""Time To Say Goodbye."" It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block. This becomes all the more apparent because Britney Spears' songwriting team was brought in to write several songs, making Simple Plan sound like a boy band. Even when they try to rock out, the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place. And there are WAY too many piano-ballads. I think any trace of the faux-punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums, which were decent efforts packed with pop-punk hooks, can permanently be removed now. Simple Plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three-plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound/style on this new one that killed their career. And the answer is neither. It is the lack of originality, energy, and songcraft that will do them in. Lets face it, when Hilary Duff rocks harder than you, your band is not ""punk."" And in the three and a half years this band was away, the scene changed, but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls ""unchartered musical territory."" Perhaps ""UnCHARTED"" musical territory is more like it. This one is headed to a bargain bin near you, right next to all those old LFO albums.","that if you rip off another band 's hits , you will sell more records .

I learned a couple of things about this duo who scraped together different styles as they were developing their own harmonic sounds. This record is pretty much an acoustic fare with their voices and guitars and their original works like Sparrow and The Sound of Silence and He Was My Brother stand head and shoulders above their covering of others songs (yes, even above Bob Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin). The mix is like a stew that gives you different flavors and textures in each bite, and doesnt taste like it really goes together, but every so often you get a particular savory taste that hits some of the right notes and you realize that you're willing to try more. The CD comes with liner notes written by Garfunkel about Simons songs. I enjoy these little peaks behind the curtains.","I was surprised to hear some traditional who scraped together different styles as they were developing their own harmonic sounds .

A4PTUEVFE13K6,B00M7LN7SM,1,1,5,"""24 Karat Gold ~ Songs From the Vault"" is a newly recorded album by Stevie Nicks, however if you didn't know better you would easily think this was a long lost album from Stevie. Going back to 2010 when Stevie was working on her ""In Your Dreams"" album she discovered one her lost demos, ""Secret Love"", on YouTube. She reworked that track for that album. Jump ahead a few years and she discovered lots more of her lost demos on YouTube and with a few weeks this past spring, she and producer Dave Stewart headed down to Nashville to rework these tracks.
 As a long time fan, I've had these demos in my collection for years, when I heard what her plan was, I was skeptical. This isn't the first time she's reworked old demos, but the results haven't always been great. Listen to her original demo for ""Smile At You"", then check out the watered down released version on Fleetwood Mac's ""Say You Will"". Would she be able to recapture the magic in these original demos, or would the suffer the same fate of ""Smile At You"" where too much time has passed and the inspiration behind the song is long forgotten. Another concern was her voice, it's aged a lot since the recording of the demos. The answer is not only do these songs come to life, but in nearly every case, outshine the demos.
  Among the highlights, the album kicks off with ""Starshine"", this is a fun rocker that is a great album opener and would also be a killer opening song on stage. If you're familiar with the demo, you'll hear how she really recaptured the feel of 1980 and the recording of the ""Bella Donna"" album right down to the organ solo.
 ""Mabel Normand"" is one of her more rare demos, the song tells the tale of the long forgotten actress but here Stevie compares her own life to that of Mabel. The song dates back to the ""Rock A Little"" era and like ""Thousand Days"" or ""Mirror Mirror"" it has an almost rambling feel to the lyric, that's not a bad thing.
 The album's title ""24 Karat Gold"" was a demo that I could never quite get into, the version here though shines. From the opening lone bass riff, which rolls into a drum beat, the song just comes to life.
 One of my favorites from the album, ""Belle Fleur"" is another of the demos that I never got into, but once again, Stevie has transformed the song into a gem. The first minute of the song here is just a chugging drum beat that hooks you just before the song has it's proper start. I also like the banjo heard throughout the song.
 ""All The Beautiful Worlds"" is a great song period. It's got a haunting tone that has a very definite late 70's/early 80's feel to it. Again here Stevie's vocals sound as strong and vibrant as they did in the 80's. With Sharon and Lori providing their background vocals, the song is classic Stevie.
 ""Lady"" was known for years among fans as ""Knocking On Doors"". Stevie wrote this back in the late 60's when she and Lindsey were trying to get noticed. Her voice has aged to perfection here. Just Stevie and a piano, that's all this song needs.
 With ""I Don't Care"" Stevie rocks out. The music track was written by Tom Petty guitarist Mike Campbell and Waddy Wachtel. It's got a swampy bluesy feel, a very different sound for Stevie. Stevie has said the end of the song lyrically was made up on the spot, honestly the whole song lyrically sounds improvised, but it works.
 ""Watch Chain"" written about Mick Fleetwood in the late 70's has retained much of the feel of the original demo. I've always liked this one and yet again, Stevie's vocals have somehow transported back to the 70's.
 ""Hard Advice"" is the sister song to 2001's ""That Made Me Stronger"", two songs written about the same conversation. In this case a conversation Stevie had with Tom Petty. This is a beautiful track.
 ""Carousel"" is a Vanessa Carlton song that Stevie did not write, however it's included here because it was one of Stevie's late mother's favorites.
 ""Blue Water"" is something of holy grail song among fans, written by Stevie with Sharon Celani back in the late 70's. I never cared for the demo, but once again the song has come alive here. She's helped out on this one with Lady Antebellum.
 ""Cathouse Blues"" was always something of a oddball among Stevie's demos. As with ""I Don't Care"" Stevie musically is trading new ground here, the song is given a jazzy treatment along with dixieland horns. Yes, it works.
 ""The Dealer"" has long been one of my favorites, one can assume it was one of Stevie's favorites as well, as she has recorded several demos of this. This version is slowed down a bit from the 1970's demo, and some of the excitement from the original demo is missing. However if you've never heard the demo, then there is much to like here.
 Closing out the album is ""She Loves Him Still"", another track she's attempted a few times. Some don't like the woodwind on this, I think it fits the song. Years have passed since she wrote this and she has moved on from whatever inspired her, but yet she sings it as if it was inspired just yesterday.

 Stevie said recently that she couldn't write these songs today. She's right, she's moved on and grown since these songs were written, in some ways these are really very simple songs. In every way though these are classic Stevie songs. This is very much the most pure Stevie album we've ever gotten.  Many of these songs probably wouldn't have been hits during the time they were written and that's probably why they were left behind. Looking back on these songs now, the heartbreak that inspired them has healed and now the songs are allowed to shine.
 In some ways this doesn't feel like a new album at all, it seems almost like a greatest hits album. At the same time it IS a new album filled with classic Stevie moments.",""" 24 Karat Gold ~ Songs From the Vault "" is a newly recorded album by Stevie Nicks , however if you did not know better you would easily think this was a long lost album from Stevie . when Stevie was working on her "" In Your Dreams "" album she discovered one her lost demos , "" Secret Love "" , on YouTube . and she discovered lots more of her lost demos on YouTube As a long time fan , I have had these demos in my collection for years , when I heard what her plan was , I was skeptical . but the results have not always been great . Listen to her original demo for "" Smile At You "" , then check out the watered down released version on Fleetwood Mac 's "" Say You Will "" . Would she be able to recapture the magic in these original demos , or would the suffer the same fate of "" Smile At You "" and the inspiration behind the song is long forgotten . Another concern was her voice , it is aged a lot since the recording of the demos . but in nearly every case , outshine the demos . Among the highlights , the album kicks off with "" Starshine "" , this is a fun rocker that is a great album opener and would also be a killer opening song on stage . and the recording of the "" Bella Donna "" album right down to the organ solo . "" Mabel Normand "" is one of her more rare demos , the song tells the tale of the long forgotten actress and like "" Thousand Days "" that is not a bad thing . The album 's title "" 24 Karat Gold "" was a demo From the opening lone bass riff , One of my favorites from the album , "" Belle Fleur "" is another of the demos but once again , Stevie has transformed the song into a gem . that hooks you just before the song has it is proper start .

I have listened to ""ARCHANGEL"" several times, and there are a few songs that stand out above the rest.  One of them is ""Nero"" [Track 7], which was recently used in the first trailer for the upcoming film adaptation of ""Anna Karenina"".  The music was perfectly utilized in that trailer, and proves that the music of Two Steps From Hell can have an even more powerful impact when put to images.

A few of my other favorite tracks are ""Everlasting"" [Track 3] and ""Ironwing"" [Track 18], although there are many others that are unique as well and my favorites are always changing!

The second disc recorded on the 22nd, features Egyptian percussionist Hamza El Din and his choir on Ollin Arageed before leading into Deal. Next up is a sweet Peggy-O followed by a hot Jack Straw. The Scarlet Begonias->Fire On The Mountain is hot followed by an equally impressive Not Fade Away->Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad with legendary guitarist John Cipollina guesting on the last half of the release.

I have definitely loved their first song Breakeven when it came out 3 years ago. But sadly, their later songs haven't been able to thrive in regards to voice and spirit. That is the case with their latest song Hall Of Fame, the lead single from their third album, #3. The song is alright, but not absolutely anything out of the ordinary from what I have heard from The Script, and from other artists before. I definitely am appealed to The Script, because they have made better music than a lot of other acts out there right now. I just hope there is better music from them down the road soon.

A2KI1SGCZT2OEI,B006ABZY7C,1,1,5,"I paid all of $1.99 for this set of MP3s, and it was well worth it.

The main attraction here are the symphonies. Recorded by BIS in exceptional sound, and featuring the Swedish Chamber Orchestra under Thomas Dausgaard, this is one of the liveliest Schumann cycles one could ever hope to hear. The tempos are swift throughout, but the playing is crystal clear and does get weighty when needed. Personally, I like an even-weightier account of this music. I like my brass to sound regal, rather than punchy. But one can't deny that the orchestral playing is super, that the choirs are all well balanced, that the voicings are superb and that the musical gestures one expects are made, if at a quicker tempo than one is used to hearing. This is a great cycle for those who find Schumann to be lugubrious or overwrought. None of that here, and a MUCH cheaper way to acquire the cycle than through buying it on CD at $14 a pop.

Major piano pieces are also included, also in excellent sound.

The rest of the set is good, though I wonder why the Piano Quintet is absent.

Highly recommended at 10 times the price.","and it was well worth it . The main attraction here are the symphonies .

A3W0POMI33YQXQ,B004CA2QRO,1,1,4,"Jazmine Sullivan returns with her sophomore album Love Me Back and it is an outstanding effort.  With a voice reminiscent of Mary J. Blige in terms of pure passion and emotion, she makes you feel every word she's singing.  She reemerged on the scene earlier this year with her single Going In Circles which was a throwback to 90's R&B but updated for 2010.  It's arguably her greatest song to date.  When she is singing about pain such as the second single 10 Seconds, she has that rare quality in her voice that is distinguishable and unique.  She's easily one of the most soulful artists to emerge in the past 5 years.  True soul music.

The album delivers on that premise with song after song of great arrangements, soulful singing, and great lyrics.  She brings out her inner 80's on Don't Make Me Wait and Ne-Yo serves as the only guest on the duet U Get On My Nerves.  The only songs I'm not really feeling are Love You Long Time & Redemption, not because they are horrible songs it's just that I'm not really feeling their vibe.

Jazmine Sullivan comes through with another solid effort that showcases her talents and is thoroughly enjoyable.  She is a True talent in music and this album is worth a purchase as it has powerful songs with plenty of replay value.  She has that voice that makes your hair stand up in the back of your neck. You definitely won't be disappointed with this album if you are a fan of Jazmine or quality R&B/Soul music.  4.4 Stars.","Jazmine Sullivan returns with her sophomore album Love Me Back and it is an outstanding effort .

Guitar work is very decent, as is Robb's drumming.  Overall sound in ""heavy"" in the bass and drums, which is a plus here complimenting the themes in the songs.

The instrumentation is spot on and full of energy and the vocals are rich and capture the era with accuracy that True swing lovers will appreciate.

I was going to compare Nickelback's songs to ""Bah Bah Black Sheep"" but I think that would be a misrepresentation -- ""Bah Bah Black Sleep"" is far more musically sophisticated. Actually, if you give a caveman an electric guitar, he will probably write better songs than the Nickelback guy because he is not chained to the modern Zeitgeist of three-chord gorilla-rock, three-note vocal melodies, and pathetic drummers that barely navigate an eighth-note rock beat (and even then with zero variation). It's not even a matter of the music being pathetically basic (it's a contingent relationship rather than a necessary one) -- the music is just flat-out crappy. The lyrics approach new standards of verbal diarrhea, and yet with the way certain lines are emphasized you just KNOW they *think* they write really clever lyrics.

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B0018M8V82,1,1,5,"Forget everything you knew about Coldplay, ""Speed of Sound,"" ""Clocks,"" all have been turned upside-down in amazing and glorious fashion. Coldplay drops their trademark sound for something completely different, and the world of music might never be the same again.

The sound is possibly indie, definitely something out of the U.K., and certainly something new we've never heard before. It's surreal, it's art, it's a new breed of rock. The lyrics are not as cryptic as previous efforts, but still not a spelled out song, with the only chorus making a shred of sense, ""If you love me, won't you let me know?"" A haunting picture is painted of winter, and the song certainly paints and fits the mood.

Chris Martin never sounded better vocally, and they go perfectly with the song. As for catchiness, I don't think this is one you'll be singing in the grocery store, but you'll remember the general feel of the song.
As for negatives,  there isn't any. Take the song, or leave it. It certainly won't appeal to everyone.

Overall, not the first thing you'd think of when it comes to summer music, but I see a world in which this song becomes a big hit. Certainly over the pond. The song is a haunting painting of ole', with originality, and the element that really makes the song, the mood. You might not find another thing like it, and you're certainly not going to confuse it with something else. Let more U2 comparisons come in, they're as good, and should be as successful. Take it or leave it, Coldplay never ceases to amaze.","Forget everything you knew about Coldplay , "" Speed of Sound , "" "" Clocks , "" all have been turned upside - down in amazing and glorious fashion .

And they do it royally on this the third installment of their trio albums: Twenty cuts are included on this third CD, along with numbers 1 (1987) and 2 (1999). Several selections are alternate takes of the two previous recordings, but at least half of them have not been released before. The final harvest is a rich one: Waltz Across Texas Tonight, Softly and Tenderly, Farther Along, Mr. Sandman, Wildflowers, My Dear Companion, Making Plans, Grey Funnel Line, etc.. Then there is that jewel written by Doyle Lawson, Charlie Waller  and Robert Yates Calling My Children Home. That song alone is worth the price of this reasonably priced three CD pack. This remains one of my favorite bluegrass songs ever. I have Emmy singing it solo, Garrison Keillor and the Hopeful Gospel Quartets version and the Country Gentlemans (that was once Lawson and Wallers group) rendition. My vote for best arrangement will always be the one by the San Francisco group Chanticleer. This a cappella group of twelve men do something magic with this song for almost seven ethereal minutes. The trios version (a cappella of course) certainly is a close second.

The pack has a lot of photos of the three women together and single, both as adults and from their childhoods. Also included are comments on the music by Dolly, Emmylou and Linda along with others.

This is another classic that time forgot about, and now is available in digital format. Catchy tune, and good lyrics.

Its important to introduce the newer generation to the previous generations music, that is what keeps the memories alive and opens up their minds to other genres of music rather then the radio kill they play today.

A26N27LJVQNVI1,9714721180,-1,1,4,"These single disc remasters were done on the cheap end. They didn't even bother to paint the disc. The only thing telling you this is remastered is a little snippet in the booklet, which is basically just the cover, back, and a page with lyrics. It's all fairly pedestrian. I literally sent the first disc back because I thought it was the 80s disc. I cannot believe they went so cheap on these. It is literally almost impossible to tell this is a remastered disc.

The three disc Master of Puppets release is by far the best one for the affordable versions. The remaster here has some slight tweaking, but otherwise sounds nearly the same as the old disc. Dynamic range is still very good for metal. If you want to revisit these classics, these cheap editions are the way to do it. I just wish they had given the buyer any clue how to differentiate these besides the small snippet in the cheap booklet. Bare minimum quality digipack, but it is low cost I guess. I just expected some kind of decent booklet with this remaster.","These single disc remasters were done on the cheap end . They did not even bother to paint the disc . It is all fairly pedestrian .

Musically, he had been absent from making new music for quite awhile, and a few years ago, he did make a splash again, teaming up again with his old prodigy, the great Toni Braxton on their Love, Marriage & Divorce album. The album was pretty good, but sadly did not do very well in regards in sales. Now, he is set to try it again on his own, after being absent from making music on his own. His latest song We've Got Love, is not actually one of his better songs. Instead, the song feels very weak from the heart. I found this track, to ignite less than the classic balladry he had been known for for songs he had like When Can I See You Again, and songs he had written for Toni, as well as Whitney Houston, and others. Hopefully, when Babyface does come out with his next album, there will be better songs than this one.

Many...most of these tracks are snippets of starts or parts of songs. Granted, they provide great anticipation when they start out but they stop before they ever develop into anything measurable. The production quality is superb as you would expect from these guys but I'm a bit disheartened. Possibly my expectations were just too lofty; that being said, Pink Floyd had never previously failed to meet and exceed my overly lofty expectations.

Even the album's cover echoed the solo theme, with Fogerty silhouetted as each of the fictional group's five members. Try as he might to distance himself from Creedence, however, his unmistakable voice and a track list of country songs upon which many of his own songs were built, couldn't help but point to his previous work.

Thirty-six years later Fogerty has brought elements of the Blue Ridge Rangers' ethos back to the studio. Unlike the Rangers' first effort, this is more capstone and reminiscence than a place to gather oneself between career phases. More importantly, rather than layering his own instrumental and vocal performances in the studio, Fogerty's put together an actual Blue Ridge Rangers with the talents of guitarist Buddy Miller, steel/mandolin/dobro player Greg Leisz, drummer Kenny Aranoff and many others. He's also chosen to share the microphone with Eagles Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit on Rick Nelson's ""Garden Party,"" and Bruce Springsteen on the Everly Brothers' ""When Will I Be Loved.""

The song list remains an all-covers affair, including an earthy take of Fogerty's own ""Change in the Weather"" that drops the unfortunate mid-80s production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-of-the-Zombie/dp/B00005B7FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye of the Zombie</a>'s original. There are classic country tunes from Ray Price, Buck Owens and the Kendalls, but Fogerty also reaches to fellow singer-songwriters John Prine, Rick Nelson and John Denver, and favorites from Delaney & Bonnie, Pat Boone and the 1964 Jumpin' Gene Simmons R&B novelty, ""Haunted House."" Highlights include Prine's environmentalist lyric of a bucolic childhood literally trucked away by a coal company and a take of Denver's ""Back Home Again"" that's adds a bit of Neil Young-like reediness to the original.

Fogerty sounds relaxed and at home surrounded by fiddle and steel and riding a Ray Price shuffle beat, and the husk of his voice adds an element of solemn pain and earthen soul to Pat Boone's melodramatic death ballad, ""Moody River."" The album closes with an overcooked Cajun-rock arrangement of ""When Will I Be Loved"" that has Fogerty and Springsteen reprising Phil and Don Everly. Though it's more of a lark than an artistic summit, it's great to hear two modern icons wailing away at their shared roots. That really sums up Fogerty's decision to bring the Blue Ridge Rangers back to life, as it's an opportunity for a great artist to revel in his equally great influences.

Bread provided music of the 70's that was approachable to a wider audience. While many hard rock fans dismissed them, a few decades on I appreciate them more than when they were performing. I appreciate how much they meant to friends and family just a bit older than me too.

I'm glad I gave them another look. It was well worth it and :""Make it with You"" is well worth 5 stars to me.

A2TWT7ZPBBYZYF,B004DN89IK,1,1,5,"The first new studio album in five years from Grammy Award-winning Texas guitar hero Eric Johnson has finally arrived, and it's quite the trip - and well worth the wait. Like his other CDs a mix of instrumentals and vocal songs mostly penned by him and showcasing his unique virtuosity on the electric guitar, Up Close includes some of the best work that Johnson has ever written and recorded.

The album is dripping with crackling guitars. If a guitar died and went to heaven, this is what heaven would sound like. Johnson is on fire, effortlessly weaving incredible, sparkling solos in and out of both the instrumental and vocal tracks. The vocal songs range from energetic blues and rock numbers to gorgeous, heartfelt ballads. Inspired like never before, Johnson plays and sings with a fervor not present in his previous work. Perhaps Johnson is like a fine vintage wine, improving with age.

I was first introduced to the music of Johnson 20 years ago by an employee at a local cable television station I was interning at during my senior year of high school. That was the year Johnson, then 36 years old, released his breakthrough second album, Ah Via Musicom, which achieved the distinction of having three instrumental songs reach the American Top Ten.

As accomplished and groundbreaking as Ah Via Musicom and its edgier and sonically more expansive 1996 follow-up, Venus Isle, are, Johnson has really poured his living, breathing essence into Up Close. The result is the best guitar-based album of the last several years, and one of the best guitar-based and general music albums of all time.

With Up Close, Johnson is at the top of his game as a guitarist, composer, and singer. He has created a masterwork of soulful jazz/pop/rock fusion that exudes passion, especially through his trademark virtuosic guitar sound. Even with guest vocals by Malford Milligan, Steve Miller, and Johnny Lang, and guitar performances by Jimmie Vaughan, Steve Hennig, and Sonny Landreth, the album is clearly all Eric Johnson up close front and center.","The first new studio album in five years from Grammy Award - winning Texas guitar hero Eric Johnson has finally arrived , and well worth the wait .

A18LYA95666ABF,B013H1HRDG,1,1,5,"A member of one of the most famous families from Bohemia, Franz Benda (1709-1789) entered into the service of Frederick the Great in 1732. As a violin master, he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period. He also wrote a lot of violin music, 110 solo capriccios, at least 150 sonatas, 31 duets and some 28 concertos, including this one in D Major.

With a crisply articulated intro, the Allegro ma non molto features a harpsichord continuo and string dominated orchestral support. As a transitional work from the Baroque, it contains more interplay between the single violin and the symphonic tutti than was the norm for the prevalent Italian style. Smoothly flowing, Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy, letting the melodic lines develop naturally. In the minor keyed Largo, the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova. With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register, she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that must be similar to the reported quality that set apart Bendas adagio playing. Horns appear for the brisk finale, a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string.

A generation or two later, Bohemian born Vaclav Pichl (1741-1805) studied philosophy and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan. After 21 years, he returned to Vienna and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace.
His D Major Concerto Op. 3, No. 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto, clipped and precise. While still employing the harpsichord as continuo, the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra, engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas, including one haunting echo in minor. A higher degree of technical proficiency of the single violin is also required.

A minor keyed charmer, the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings. Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin, the very first notes of the concluding Rondo. Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings, a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale.

By another Bohemian, the final concerto represents the culmination of the Viennese High Classical style. Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso, Antonin Vranicky (1761-1820) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos, one of which is the C Major included on this recording.

Using tympani and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors, the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto. Amid a longer, more extensive development section, the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows, the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register. After a chorale like start, the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close. Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto, the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance. With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm, this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude, dazzling flourishes from the violin and a rousing finish.

The original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine, placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear. Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik, the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos. But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova. This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry.","A member of one of the most famous families from Bohemia , Franz Benda ( 1709 - 1789 ) entered into the service of Frederick the Great in 1732 .

The album starts off fine with ""Good As Gone.""  This tune drifts solidly into their radio hit, ""Boondocks.""  This song, while drowning in commercial pop country lyrics, stands apart from most modern country due to the nice four-part harmony of the group.  Another standout from this album is their other radio release, ""Bring It On Home.""  In fact, this is probably the strongest song on the album.  ""Wounded"" has a nice sound as well.  Songs like ""Bones,"" ""A Little More You,"" and ""Looking For A Reason,"" are good, but they all begin to sound alike as the album rolls along.  The only glaring downfall in this album is the hokey, pop country drivel, ""Welcome To The Family.""  It falls into the same category as other silly tunes like ""American Honky Tonk Bar Association,"" where it seems that the songwriter tries too hard to make a cheesy country tune.

If you enjoy earthy, mostly acoustic four-part harmony, you'll enjoy this album.  People who likes glitzier country groups like Rascal Flatts will probably like this, though it's quite a bit grittier than the bland Flatts sound.  Fans of bluegrass-tinged groups such as Diamond Rio and even the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band will probably enjoy this much more.

Overall, a highly recommended album, though Little Big Town hasn't quite set themselves apart from the crowd.","The album starts off fine with "" Good As Gone .

A1WPFIZ8P3O86V,B01CKY60TI,1,1,5,"Before purchasing this new Bach Guild release, I made a quick check of my own collection just to be sure that I didn't already have it. After all, they've given us so many great collections by now that it's hard to keep track of them all. I don't know how many they've released altogether, and I sure don't have all of them myself, but I did find (somewhat to my surprise) that I've managed to accumulate 26 of them (now 27 with this addition), totaling almost 210 hours of music! That is remarkable, not only for the quantity of music but most notably for the bargains these sets have provided.

And here we have the latest, this time bringing together 16 violin concertos from 14 different composers (Mozart given extra representation with three of his violin concertos). And as we've come to expect, very capable performances throughout. The two concerto performances by David Oistrakh and with Kiril Kondrashin conducting the State Orchestra of U.S.S.R are historic recordings dating from the late 1940's but presented here in very acceptable sound quality. Joseph Silverstein's recordings of the violin concertos of Mendelssohn, Mozart, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky are notable, as are the performances by Misha Elman with Vladimir Golschmann conducting, giving us concertos by Lalo, Saint-Sans, Bach, Nardini and Vivaldi. Contrast those historic performances with the Bruch concerto and Scottish Fantasy performed by the Japanese violinist Yuzuko Horigome

There is some overlap with the Bach Guilds earlier 'Big Violin Box' and 'Big Baroque Box Vol III' (see notes below) so for those who have already acquired that set this is a point to be aware of. Still, for 99 cents a bit of duplication is not objectionable.

A10DNCYK7YISHU,B000QZWZ2A,1,1,5,"'The Soul Purpose' was an exceptionally good release from 7L & Eso that was really unfairly hated upon.  It was a 20 track CD filled with a lot of good songs (""Speaking Real Words"" ""Jealous Over Nothing"", accompanied by some average tracks (""You Know The Concept"" ""Mic Mastery""), and a few that didn't come all that well (""Guestlist"")...  It probably was hated upon because of Eso's previous cyborg-android scientific type of material switched over to a cocky arrogant battler with simpler rhyming schemes.
Where ever there were mistakes on 'The Soul Purpose', 'Dangerous Connection' not only corrects them, but PERFECTS everything on the album!  Every single track is banging on this album!!  7L's mediocre production has improved exponentially and Esoteric's flow just compliments the beats even more.  Plus if you felt that there was too much battle type of material on the last album, 'Dangerous Connection' comes with a bunch of good conceptual songs...
""Terrorist's Cell"" - first off ANYTHING produced by Stoupe (jedi mind tricks) will have an off the wall type of beat.  Esoteric's lyrics explain the mind of a 9/11 terrorist going through with his crusade... but after finally seeing his wrongdoing it's too late... This is not only a controversial song, but it is executed INCREDIBLY well (the re-play button will be on this for a few times)...
""Word Association"" - another creative track where Esoteric raps about being a psychotic patient rapping 'word association' with a doctor.  A very humorous track...
""Stalker"" - a hilarious tale about a guy who stalks teenage girls that he has fantasies of... this runs along the same type of humor ""Jealous over Nothing"" had...
""Herb"" - along with teenyboppers and Nelly fans, herbs are something else I detest.  Esoteric arrogantly defines the term herb all throughout the track ...
""Rest In Peace"" - a clever concept song where Eso rhymes about himself passing on and how his music ALL OF A SUDDEN is known, and how there are album profit problems among his family and friends...
And the rest of the tracks are the usual Esoteric battle/android type of material... NOTHING on this material is WEAK by any means (there are no blunders like Guestlist)...  The ONLY thing that annoyed me about this CD is that it was kinda short in comparison with Soul Purpose.  But the REALLY hot beats and rhymes make up for the length... remember its QUALITY folks not QUANTITY

A3PFHVS7V4UZTG,B0070LQJ7U,1,1,4,"Call this Drama II if you will, well, maybe not, but because it's another lead singer and doing another album I figured that's a good title. Well, the bashing has already begun as I knew it would from rabid Yes fans who just can't do without Jon Anderson on vocals. To be honest, not everything he has sung with Yes is five star either so to give this a bomb of a review based on that is totally unfair. How many bands have enlisted other lead singers over the years and based on that these groups wouldn't have been - Asia without John Wetton, Bad Company without Paul Rodgers, Foreigner without Lou Gramm, Genesis without Peter Gabriel, Journey without Steve Perry, Marillion without Fish, Spock's Beard without Neal Morse, Van Halen without David Lee Roth. You get my point, bands change over the years, band members come and they go. So, the morbid fascination with one particular member and not letting it go - boring. For this album, great release. You have to go into this open minded and not expect a Jon Anderson release, period. If you can past that and just listen to it on its own merits then it's a great listen. Benoit David does a great job and although he doesn't hit the high notes like Anderson (much like every lead singer after Steve Perry can't hit them either) he still delivers a great album. Everyone is going to pick this album apart and want to hear 'Tales' or 'Relayer' or 'Fragile'. Well, if that's what you're looking for don't bother with this release and pop those others into your player and keep listening to them over and over and over, again. Being familiar with Benoit David from his other group 'Mystery' I can say I enjoy this album. The opening track is great (although I wish they would have made it one track instead of several - but I Tunes lets you join the tracks so I can listen to it in its entirety in my mix) and I find nothing wrong with it and it's the centerpiece to the album. If you like this release check out Benoit David's other releases with 'Mystery' entitled 'Beneath the Veil of Winter's Face' and their latest 'One Among the Living'. With so much garbage out there today in the music industry how can anyone complain about this and there isn't any way it deserves a one star rating. I give it between 4 and 5 stars and do really wish they would have clocked it up to the 80 minute mark which shouldn't have been difficult to do, especially after having to wait 10 years for new music from this supergroup.","Call this Drama II if you will , well , maybe not , but because it is another lead singer because it is another lead singer that is a good title .

A328S9RN3U5M68,B0049SEVDQ,1,-1,3,"As one who has not heard the voice of Susan Boyle before, it may be unfair to judge a talent on the basis of one recording.  However, in looking for the seasonal recordings to recommend, this one, THE GIFT, certainly has to be considered because of the overwhelming popularity of Miss Boyle and the consistently high sales of her recordings.  The voice is pleasant and communicative and honest and that is refreshing.  The few songs that are offered here do not a full album make, but Boyle does give a lovely rendition of the light popular voice offering Christmas wishes. She is not to be compared with classical singers because that is simply not her category.  And while many music lovers of all kinds of singing voices will and have snapped up the Christmas albums of, say,  Jessye Norman, Kathleen Battle, Kiri Te Kanewa etc etc, that is not to say this little recording is not worth adding to the collection. It is quiet, suffused with choral background and is .... pleasant listening.

But sadly, just because you are a main star out there, doesn't mean you have excellent song choice at the end of the day. Drunk In Love, the lead single from Beyonce' Knowles self-titled record is not actually a striking note. I really found the song to be not just incredibly weak in voice, but the words firmly did not strike from the soul of the heart. I found the song to be less impressive than the weak songs she had done from her last record 4 a few years ago. She really didn't ignite from the soul in the she could've from the mood of the music. I think she also could find a better partner to ignite the mood than her husband. It gets too tiring after awhile.

A2R35DE00SQDJQ,B00AFXD08Q,1,1,5,"Tim's music is something he characterizes as ""instrumental pop,"" which reflects influences from new age, rock, popular, and even classical music. Right from the opening track, a blend of distinctive melody and impressive technique is evident. Although the track, entitled ""What Will I Be,"" is barely over 2 minutes long, it feels like a complete composition and exhibits a surprising dynamic range in its brief lifespan. In fact, all but one song out of twelve are under 3:15 in length. This brings the total time of the CD to around 33 minutes - relatively short for a CD, but like a buffet of extremely rich food, small portions are just right. By the end you certainly feel like you've had a very full listening experience, given the intricacy and diversity of Tim's music. Although the piano is the centerpiece of the album, lush orchestration tastefully compliments the compositions. Synthesizers and samplers add the sound of strings and woodwinds, while the acoustic guitar of Rick Henley provides accompaniment on some songs.

Neo-classical and rock influences combine on ""Awaken The Dawn,"" in a virtuoso high velocity piece that brought to mind the keyboard wizardry of progressive rockers like Rick Wakeman of Yes, and Keith Emerson from Emerson Lake and Palmer. A nice contrast to this style is a tune called ""Hopefaith,"" which showcases the more gentle side of Tim's playing, yet also exhibits his dynamic range within the boundaries of a song. I was impressed with Tim's abilities as a composer and arranger, as well as with how much detail and complexity he was able to imbue in some of his relatively compact compositions. A song entitled ""Hide And Seek"" is built on a simple descending motif, providing a platform for lavish orchestration to add to the cinematic air. I appreciated that Tim chose to end the album with one of his most sensitive compositions, ""Stratford Road."" This was the perfect one to provide closure after a CD's worth of intricate, and often intense piano virtuosity. This piece had a pleasant pastoral quality that I found emotionally evocative. In general, the music on this album lends itself more to active listening, than background ambience. Timothy Crane has crafted a spirited mlange of diverse ingredients and influences in the music of ""Pianoforte.""","Tim 's music is something he characterizes as "" instrumental pop , "" which reflects influences from new age , rock , popular , Right from the opening track , a blend of distinctive melody and impressive technique is evident .

A3747YPXOBXRAT,B005IVVPNC,1,1,5,"Wonderfully atmospheric music, perfect for any contemplative need. I use it for background when I need to get intensely creative at work, though I sometimes end up breaking off to listen hard.

A mixture of achingly beautiful slow string pieces, fingerstyle guitar works, light instrumental poppy pieces and three unexpected breaks - gypsy dance music, Alanis Morrisette's ""Thank U""  and Nick Drake's ""Pink Moon"". It all works wonderfully. The Tyler Bates tracks feature all sorts of subtle touches to convey a Spanish, Catalonian or Basque feel by turns.

Hang on, I forgot that James Taylor's ""Country Road"" is in there too. Also ""Fusco"", a Spanish song credited to Berroguetto. It's a lively song sung to a full rock band backing. Oh, and David Gray's ""My Oh My"" is included.

Oh heck, check the track listing for yourself. And while you are at it listen to the samples.

On the basis of this album I'll be looking for other stuff by Tyler Bates.

The perfect soundtrack to the film too, which if you haven't seen you should.

Definitely one of my luckiest finds musically.

Sadly, I really found that there could've been more brought out from Mariah into the song. It seemed like Miguel brought out more to chew out Mariah Carey out of her own duet. It isn't a bad song, but there really wasn't enough chemistry both of them had shown into the connection of the song. I think Mariah Carey should really reconsider starting from scratch and find her voice all over again, before she makes another weak song.

For starters, that hypnotic ""Get Up, Get Up, Get Up, Get Up"" hook that is softly whispered over the rhythmic beat calls us into the theme of the track. Marvin's voice is like that of an ecstatic angel living with one foot in the clouds and another in the entrance way to the bedroom. I can picture hips gyrating, beautiful women dancing in the background, red satin sheets, candles, rose petals and the whole bit.

In all my years of listening to music, never have I heard a song quite so stirring and smooth. Marvin states in no uncertain times that he is seeking some sexual healing from his partner (or partners) and is not shy about laying his cards right out there throughout the duration of the song. The song starts beautifully and truly ends too quickly.","If anyone is looking for an introduction to Marvin Gaye at one of his finest hours , vocally , "" Sexual Healing "" is a prime example .

A2MU30JJ36LSAD,B00OE1VG6I,1,1,5,"Even for the most ardent and knowledgeable fan of the Bach Guild/Vanguard catalog, this collection might be a bit of a surprise. Certainly this collection shows the trademarks of the early 1950s era Bach Guild catalog, as the repertoire leans toward the baroque and classical masters. But this collection is more a tribute to the machinery that kept a small classical label alive. And the depth of the repertoire for brass and winds came as a small surprise  although it started as a tribute to a forgotten corner of the catalog.

Some history  the post World War II time frame for The Bach Guild chronicles a richly fertile artistic period, where technology met art and both formed a marketplace. The scholarly rage that followed the end of the war, where students could at last find access to papers that had been off limits for over twenty years, unearthed a vein of musicology that revealed to the world undiscovered works by great composers, and new scholarship about the works once thought well known. The Solomon brothers were among the first to find Vienna at the center of this scholarship and the difficult post-war conditions gave them inexpensive access to musicians in one of the great music cities in the world. So, with the Solomon family money providing the technology, and local scholars eager to test their new discoveries and a city of starving musicians, The Bach Guild produced a vault of recordings of considerable artistic breadth.

And with a city of fine musicians all looking for work, performing this repertoire was not difficult, as any combination of instruments could be matched easily and inexpensively. The Solomons were approached in the mid 1950s by the Austrian government and asked to create Austro-Vanguard, and investors were even brought into the equation, with the concept that Vanguard would establish a studio in Vienna and make a guaranteed number of recordings. From existing letters, neither brother was very excited by the idea, as they didn't want the issues that came with running a studio thousands of miles away (they didn't want own their own studio in the US either), and they figured they could work something out to get just what they wanted instead of a flood of recordings that they could barely control and that might send costs upward. So they continued to record three months a year, and the Viennese recording team was free to make recordings at their own, and Vanguard would have rights of refusal. Thus were made many Vienna State Opera Orchestra recordings, as well as the early recordings of the Concentus Musicus Wien.
That defines a large number of recordings in the Vanguard catalog. In order to exploit this wide array, the Solomons hit on the idea of the Virtuoso series, and they collected new recordings and released them according to instrument. So the Vanguard catalog has a series of Virtuoso recordings: Trumpet (3 volumes), Oboe (4 volumes and an orphan); Flute (3 recordings); Guitar (2 recordings and a few duplications); Harp (1); Clarinet (1); Harpsichord (2); recorder (1) and even a piano recording but that wasn't part of the original series. The recordings were made in Vienna and Prague.

Weve combined recordings from trumpet, oboe, clarinet and recorder, as well as some other recordings featuring the horn and the bassoon from other corners of the catalog. Flute, you ask? There is none  there is so much of it, that we released all of that repertoire in the Big Flute Box earlier this year.

We also normally try and make these collections as complete as we can, but in the attempt to create a box that didn't tilt too heavily in the direction of the reed instruments (yes, four oboe recordings, with almost 4 hours of oboe repertoire seems a bit much for one box), we shaved a few recordings off this list, and placed those recordings in our upcoming Big Baroque Box 3.
Our usual rundown of unreleased goodies  theres quite a bit here that has gone unreleased. About half of the oboe concertos that we have included are making their digital debut and most of them have gone unheard for a while  Vanguard collectors will remember a bad attempt at lifestyle compilations called Music for People Who Hate Opera that included the romantic era oboe recordings as well as the Wagner clarinet work (see belowhint: theres been a bit of a change regarding that work). But all of the trumpet and recorder works are getting their digital debuts with this release. Most of the trumpet repertoire was released on CD but the recorder recordings are receiving their first hearings since their LP release.

A few points  at the request of some of our Facebook friends, we have included the recording of the Haydn oboe concerto, which we left out of our Big Haydn Box. We did that because scholarship has cast some doubt on whether this piece is by Haydn. Actually, its widely believed not to be written by Papa Haydn at all, but by Ignaz Malzat. But weve included it here because it certain does feature the oboe. Also, the well-regarded Virtuoso Clarinet recording featuring Jack Brymer is included here, but the Wagner piece Adagio for Clarinet and Strings is now attributed to Heinrich Josef Baermann.

And this leaves us with the embarrassment of riches problem  this box could have been three hours longer! As we mentioned above, the Big Baroque 3 box is expected out this year and will contain more unreleased baroque goodies from the Bach Guild vaults. Thank you Vienna!

A2QTZZ2HCFFY9L,B0070LQJ7U,1,1,5,"Note: this review applies specifically to the CD and its musical content, I have not seen the DVD.

I was fortunate to receive an advanced copy of Fly from Here the new album by Yes, and it is a masterpiece! The album itself has a timeless quality about it, and is a pleasure to listen to.
Trevor Horn ex-lead singer for Yes is once again with the band as strictly a producer/cowriter, and the product is brilliant.
Note: (Trevor Horn replaced Jon Anderson as lead vocalists in the band for the Drama album exclusively, as well as the tour in support of the album).
 This release also marks the debut of Benot David the new lead singer for Yes, and I have to say I am extremely impressed with his vocals. David appears to sometimes sound a bit like Anderson, but more like Horn, so much so that at times one might think they were listening to something from Drama that was never released. That in fact is not far from the truth, as the title track ""Fly from Here"" an epic six part piece is based on a demo from 1980 entitled ""We Can Fly from Here"". Having expanded the demo track into the epic it now is was a fantastic idea, and it works mainly due to Benot David's vocal similarity to Trevor Horn. The other five tracks are primarily stand-alone tunes and are beautifully written and performed by the band as a whole. Rejoining Yes for Fly from Here is yet another member of the band from the Drama album, on keyboards completely outdoing himself is Geoff Downes, and Geoff is at the top of his game, and is refreshing to hear performing at his progressive rock peak. Longtime Yes members Chris Squire , Alan White, and Steve Howe are also in rare form, especially throughout the six part ""Fly from Here"".
This album signifies a new beginning for Yes, and brings us some closure from the days of Drama (one of my favorite albums), as well as opening the future for the band building on the Drama sound and taking it to an entirely new level. Fly from Here in many ways is the follow-up to Drama ,that we as Yes fans never got, and although many fans may refuse to accept any other singer then Jon Anderson, get over it! Change can be a good thing, and in the case of Fly from Here an exceptional musical experience!","I was fortunate to receive an advanced copy of Fly from Here the new album by Yes , and it is a masterpiece ! and is a pleasure to listen to .

Their newly-released self-titled album regains that power, and the problems that plagued the previous two albums are very little. You have the radio-friendly vibe of DEVELOPMENT, the agressive nu-metal hooks of STATEMENT and TO THE PAIN, the variety of RECOIL, and the metal-like aspects of VENGEANCE and MIRACLE, all bundled together in a 12-song review of NONPOINT'S musical journey. This record is also somehow heavier than the previous albums, and has much more obtrusive production courtesy of JOHNNY K, who has worked with STAIND, SEVENDUST, and DISTURBED.

 to his 78 fantastic solo album was worth the wait . It is not a KISS 

 album ! who expected Love Gun are probably not happy . and love into this album every 

 song has something to offer if your a fan or even if your not a fan 

 of KISS . Songs like the Live to Win and LIft are very fresh and Paul 's 

 vocals are just a good as ever . My favorite tracks are Wake up Screaming and sound like hit singles to me . Of course the love 

 songs are there and nobody sings them better . So chill out and be happy that Paul is still making good 

 music"

AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B00122N04I,1,1,4,"Excellent followup for Robert Randolph and the Family Band's underground classic ""Live at the Wetlands."" Those who liked that CD will be pleased with this one. Most of this consists of tunes that this excellent group has been performing live over the last year, like ""Run For Your Life,"" ""Good Times,"" and ""Squeeze."" Once again, John Ginty plays the heck out of his organ and Marcus Randolph and Danyel Morgan in fine support (though it would be nice if this one had more of Danyel's soaring vocals).
Overall, this is good stuff, particularly the songs that I have just mentioned. Real get-up and go music with a positive energy not often found in tunes of recent times. ""Soul Refershing"" is simply beautiful and ""Smile"" is interesting (Robert's sister Lenesha does the vocals here). ""Calypso"" (not to be confused with the Harry belafonte tune of the same name) is an interesting novelty. A few of the songs (like ""I Need More Love"") are somewhat lacking in the right mix of melody and energy that characteris\zes this group-but a so-so song from these guys are better than the best of a lot of what's out there now!
I would suggest that those who may be interested in this start with ""Live at the Wetlands"" before going on to ""Unclassified."" That will give you a better preperation for this. Then pick up ""The Word"" (RR without the Family Band) and the ""Sacred Steel"" Cds after you listen to ""Unclassified.""

AMP7TQRWAIE84,B002FY1FK8,-1,1,4,"Mariah Carey thought at first that she wanted to come back with a ballad but she really felt the energy and the heart of this song and thought it was nothing like she's ever released.

So she went with ""Obsessed"" her first single off of the then anticipated follow up to ""E=MC2"", ""Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel"".

It's an upbeat song about dissing someone who dissed her husband, her relationship and is ""obsessed"" with her for some odd reason.

""See right through you like you're bathing in windex"" is one of the many insults she puts inside the song.

At first I wasn't sure about the song and didn't think much of it but it grew on me almost immensely and now I really do like it.

And thank goodness it wasn't played out nearly as much as a Beyonce song or a Lil' Wayne song!

Written by Mariah Carey, The-Dream and Christopher ""Tricky"" Stewart.

A1XNZDOWDENTTM,B014K4HER8,1,1,5,"Yes, this has already been covered by numerous other reviewers here, but I truly believe 'Confident' is Demi Lovato's best work to date!

On her 5th album, Lovato reveals a sexy side unheard of/unseen on her previous records.  On 'Confident', Demi struts her stuff in these playful, care-free (yet more mature) tracks.  Needless to say, she doesn't give a rat's a-- what people think of her.

Reviewer Justin Alvis wrote: ""I'm glad she finally made an explicit album too (it was about time haha)"" [original review posted October 19, 2015] ...Yes, an explicit album from Lovato has been long overdue(: So glad to see she's finally broken away from the Disney mold for good!

Tracklist/notable things:

1. Confident - Great album opener! The use of horns give the song a nice touch.  Reminds me of ""The Wolf"" by Heart (if it was in a different key) ...? ok, don't ask(:  Lovato taunts the double entendre: ""It's time to get the chains out / Is your tongue tied up?""

2. Cool For The Summer - critics have compared this song to Katy Perry's ""I Kissed A Girl"" (not just in theme, but song structure as well). True, while ""CFTS"" is basically Katy's song in a different key, that doesn't make ""Summer"" bad...nice to see Lovato returning to her pop-rock roots w/ this one.

3. Old Ways - interesting beats [between verses] in this track

4. For You - sounds like an update of Miley Cyrus' ""Wreckingball""

5. Stone Cold - shows off Lovato's arresting vocals...good Lord, the girl has some serious pipes!

6. Kingdom Come (feat. Iggy Azalea) - some stated this as the album's worst track...but it's my favorite!  Perhaps Iggy's presence caused dislike?  This Lovato/Azalea collaboration turned out very...interesting.  I like it!  Hope it's a single!

7. Waitin For You (feat. Sirah) - a supposed-Miley Cyrus diss track.  Loving the chorus!

8. Wildfire - beautiful song!

9. Lionheart - based on the album's linear notes, it's an ode to child (whom I assume Lovato shared a close bond with) who passed away.

Unfortunately, it's the album's weakest track.  Demi's vocals sound strained here; pushing her voice too hard/over singing.  This song could've been so much more...unfortunately, Lovato's boisterous vocal delivery falls flat.

10. Yes - gorgeous mid-tempo gospel-tinged tune

11. Father - An emotional song that finds Lovato reflecting on her rocky relationship with her estranged [now late] biological father.  Again, gospel influences can be heard.  A beautiful album closer.

Deluxe Edition tracks:

12. Stars - reminds me of Nicki Minaj's ""Starships"".  It's ok.  Nothing special though

13. Mr. Hughes - a jazzy track that recalls Lovato's own ""Behind Enemy Lines"" (bonus track off her debut).  I also hear a tinge of (dare I say?) Amy Winehouse in Lovato's voice on this.  Lovato should really consider recording an entire jazz &/or gospel-influenced album.

I ended up also buying the newer Trinity Revisited which has all the songs remastered and includes guest singers and has a much longer version of Sweet Jane, which I like very much as well.

A24N1BAS3CU27H,B00W7XEDBK,1,1,5,"Sultry soulful UK singer/songwriter/guitarist Lianne La Havas released her critically acclaimed debut ""Is Your Love Big Enough"" in 2012. Since then, she's become friends with, and featured on the last album of none other than Prince.

Her new album ""Blood"" appears largely unaffected by that encounter, but different from her first. Largely gone is the light folky touch and in its place is a groovier heavier sound. Opening cut ""Unstoppable"" sets the tone for much of the album, a slice of dewy Marvin Gaye-esque soul. ""Who's that girl, and does the mirror world go on forever?"" she inquires on the horn-flecked ""Green And Gold"", lyrics that touch on the confusion her mixed heritage brought while growing up. With a voice capable of moving from a breathy whisper to a powerful belter as on the tender acoustic to fiery ""Grow"" or ""Midnight"" (laced with triumphant horns and hip hop beats), each of the ten tracks is special.

""Tokyo"" is a moody groove with heavenly harmonies and a mournful/squealing guitar break, while the dreamy ""Wonderful"" is aptly titled, adorned with finger-snaps, sprinklings of strings and reverbed percussion. ""Never Get Enough"" is the surprise on the album, a delicate acoustic affair sporadically interrupted with bursts of fuzzy guitar and disembodied vocals giving an indie rock feel. Closing is the hymnal and folky ""Good Goodbye"".

Sends pleasant chills running through the blood. Another winner from La Havas.","Sultry soulful UK singer / songwriter / guitarist Lianne La Havas released her critically acclaimed debut "" Is Your Love Big Enough "" in 2012 .

The main man the project being guitarist Brian Tichy who is actually best known as a drummer where he has played with the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, Billy Idol and Slash. But he certainly knows how to make riffs, Jimmy Page influenced but not in any way derivative. The rhythm section is highly adventurous and competent, cranking out effective breaks and odd metres when necessary and at the same time laying a rock solid bottom.

What really set this band apart from most other similar acts is the sheer quality of the song writing, these songs could actually work at the camp fire. The lyrics also thoughtful and intelligent.

A2R9CA3YT1WUNV,B002RDGQ1K,1,1,5,"I was expecting great things when I first bought `There's Know Place Like Home,' but the sheer quality of this DVD came as quite a surprise to me. The picture is amazing; simply brilliant with a really spectacular job in both editing and camera work which makes the DVD just so enjoyable to watch.

The sound is unbelievable; one of the best concert recordings I've come across, the concert boasts one of the greatest live drum sounds ever captured, with a huge `feel the air particles moving,' kick drum sound, a clear sharp snare sound and perfectly mixed cymbals. I have a few DVDs where rock bands play with an orchestra and I honestly believe this concert implemented the idea the best, working to augment the material instead of dominating it.

The stage looks fantastic and the lighting is really impressive, giving the whole show a really epic atmosphere, appropriate during material like the `Howling at the Moon,' section of `Magnum Opus,' or the very grand `Miracles Out of Nowhere.'

Then on top of all that, the tracklisting is excellent, paying particular focus to the classic era; all the fan favourites are here from radio legends `Point of Know Return,' `Dust In The Wind,' and `Carry On Wayward Son,' to prog masterpieces like `Song For America,' `Cheyenne Anthem,' and `Icarus: Borne on Wings Of Steel.'

The bands performance throughout is amazing, from the incredibly intricate drumming on the proggier numbers, to the soulful singing on the ballads Steve Walsh's vocal performance on `The Wall,' is pretty breathtaking and all that before even considering the violin work. Take that into account then remember there's a top notch symphony orchestra and guest performances from Kansas veterans Kerry Livgren and Steve Morse and you can just imagine what a spectacle this 35th Anniversary gig really was.

The Bonus Track, an extended version of the classic `Down The Road,' recorded in the soundcheck is particularly energetic and impressive.

If you enjoy concert DVDs or are a Kansas fan then you can't afford to be without `There's Know Place Like Home,' in terms of performance, picture and sound this is simply one of the best DVDs out there.","I was expecting great things when I first bought ` There is Know Place Like Home , ' but the sheer quality of this DVD came as quite a surprise to me .

AOWZ87AGIR2VU,B00NPZI1ZS,1,-1,3,"To put in perspective where this Pink Floyd fan is coming from, my first album bought was Obscured By Couds as a new release. I then bought Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother, Meddle, and the Syd Barrett re-releases of Saucerful and Piper (which I later sold because, I never ever did see his ""genius"", just as one more Crazy Diamond). Then came DSOTM and I have always hated the song Money, but liked most of the album except for all the alarms. Eventually, the very cynical Animals became my all time favorite and I liked them all the way up to Division Bell. I liked The Wall and The Final Cut, but felt that these were just absolutely brilliant lyrical venting on Roger's part, which had all of us paying fans acting as his psychiatric couch. Must be nice, which is why I welcomed Momentary Lapse Of Reason and still love that one.

So, I got really psyched up when I found out about this release and researched it until I could find leaked You Tube songs. The first ones that I heard really threw me for a loop and I got prepared for a nasty one star review calling it the soundtrack for old hippies in nursing homes. Worse than that, I was going to call it Nick Mason's last attempt at milking the udders from the cow on Atom Heart Mother for all it's worth. Instead, it is none of these nasty descriptions. What made me change my mind? I watched Anisina on You Tube and got some 5-star goose bumps. However, the only other cut that rises to this level is Surfacing.

So, just like the teenager from 40 years ago who also still does not trust the Post Office to lose his stuff, I went out and bought it locally today. I was not about to wait one more week to hear this one! The verdict: the ones that sound anything at all like Pink Floyd are few and far between on this already short album. The winners are by track number: 2, 4, 7, 11, 13, 17. Track number 5 will not make it to my iPod as it is a soundtrack for a bad trip (eventhough no one has time for that kind of thing anymore). Track number 18 is the only one with vocals and also will not make it to my iPod because the opening line sums up the part that I have hated about this band airing out their dirty laundry, ""We bitch and we fight"". Speaking of which, does anyone else notice that mainly British bands fight amongst themselves, hold grudges for years, and are also obsessed with lunacy? Get over it and give us some more good music!!!!

The 6 out of 18 cuts mentioned make for a worthwhile purchase, with Anisina being worth the price all by itself. An instant clasic cut! For those who want further clarification, I would call this genre as ""Instrumental Soundtrack"", but definitely not ""Progressive Psychedelic"", as all of their previous albums were. Do yourself a favor and check out the full videos from the tracks that I mentioned, and then decide if you want this one as a keeper. Not for everyone, but this is certainly

I remember hearing it and loving it in my childhood and teens, and even as an adult it captivated me.  Now, after Dolores' death, it's taken on a melancholy and haunting air, but it nonetheless remains one of my favorite songs.  It marries upbeat instrumentation with wistful lyrics and vocals, somehow weaving a music experience that's at once haunting and lively.

Always a classic, this song is now a bittersweet listening experience, and well worth purchasing and downloading.","With the recent passing of Dolores O'Riordan , the lead singer for the Cranberries , I have found myself revisiting this song . and loving it in my childhood and even as an adult it captivated me .

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B004EK6UGU,1,1,4,"Throughout R. Kelly's career, he has flipped-flopped back and forth between being `reserved' and being `cutting-edge.' 2009's underwhelming selling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Untitled/dp/B002LLDT86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Untitled</a>&nbsp;(a solid, Grammy-nominated R&B album) found Kelly assimilating to new trends and rehashing classic moments. Even when `Untitled' was more `reserved,' it still managed to sport a `parental advisory' label. 2010`s&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Letter/dp/B0048LDTKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Letter</a>, on the other hand, finds Kelly on the more `reserved' side. That said, Love Letter is a solid, enjoyable R. Kelly album, sexual, profane references or not.  No one would cite `Love Letter' as Kelly's best necessarily, but it is certainly one of his stronger effort in recent times. Critics who prefer the more overt, `over-the-top' persona will no doubt consider this album `too tame' or even `bland.'

After the typical `corny' R. Kelly interlude (""Love Letter Prelude"") which finds the singer ascending up a scale in thirds at one point, Kelly breaks into the pleasant, enjoyable ""Love Letter,"" which is a direct contrast to the `party-it-up' themed ""Crazy Night"" from `Untitled.'  The chorus is simple, yet memorable: ""Did you get my card/did you read my love letter/ did it touch your heart/when you read my love letter.""  Subtle it may be, Kelly sounds solid and ""Love Letter"" proves an appropriate, enjoyable opener.  ""Number One Hit"" keeps up the feel-good, low-key vibe. Kelly's vocals sit atop the restrained production well, supported by strings (pads), piano, and synthesizers.  The dramatic turn of the performance at the end is a very nice touch making ""Number One Hit"" feel like a genuine `hit.'

""Not Feeling The Love"" is nearly as enjoyable, featuring the archetypical electric-piano laden production not dissimilar from 1980s R&B.  Kelly barely breaks a sweat on the verse, but heightens the emotion near the end of the cut.  ""Lost In Your Love""  is solid enough, though it is a cut where you would like for Kelly to `push himself' more as a songwriter.  Even though it is safe and could stand more direction, it is still enjoyable and by no means `filler.' ""Just Can't Get Enough"" is a better cut, clocking in at an incredibly brief 3:10.  The only quibble would be limited songwriting, but much like ""Lost In Your Love,"" it still remains a pleasant cut.

""Taxi Cab"" does a fine job of differentiating itself from anything Kelly has done up to this  point.  While ""Taxi Cab"" does fall into the `hole' of employing some of modern R&B's `bag of gimmicks,' Kelly makes the end result one that is much more positive than negative. Again working with a narrow scope of songwriting, Kelly makes this cut exciting, if for nothing else than comparing the `taxi cab' to the `hotel room.' Now that's our R. Kelly!

""Radio Message"" is one of the album's best and most dynamic cuts, changing the groove from a straightforward four patter to a six feel, channeling classic R&B (think 50's and 60's).  Kelly also allows himself to stretch out vocally.  ""When A Woman Loves"" keeps up this `Kelly transformation,' finding `Kells' achieving some excellent vocal nuances.  The biggest quibble is that ""When A Woman Loves"" is too lengthy, clocking in at over five minutes.

""Love Is"" featuring K. Michelle keeps the momentum high, with the only quibble being the questionable vocal mix (K. Michelle could be mixed a bit closer to the forefront of the mix).  ""Just Like That"" lays well, though ""Music Must Be A Lady"" is most definitely a show stopper!  Why is it when Kelly compares women to the inanimate that he has the most success as a songwriter? The best line - ""Hey sweet soprano, I want you to meet Mr. tenor..."" ""A Love Letter Christmas"" is appropriately place in a timely manner for the holidays, while closer ""How Do I Tell Her"" ends the album as strongly as it began.

Essentially, Kelly `knocks it out of the park' on this effort, albeit more conservative than say his Twelve Play albums or his assimilation to hip-hop, 2007's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Up/dp/B000P29B3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Up</a>.  Regardless, Kelly has always and will always be a musical chameleon; he always pulls off whatever experiment he tries whether it is songwriting that compares ladies to any and everything or ""Trapped in the Closet"" with it's millions of chapters.  `Love Letter' is a must for any R. Kelly fan.","and being ` cutting - edge .

AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B003ACHIL4,1,1,4,"Gary Allan is one of the few saving graces left in country music.  In this day and age of auto-tuned superstars, it's nice to see a country rocker who likes it rough and imperfect.  Allan has already crafted two of the best country albums of modern times (SMOKE RINGS IN THE DARK and TOUGH ALL OVER), and every album he releases is a reason to rejoice.

That being said, for a Gary Allan record, GET OFF ON THE PAIN doesn't quite stand up.  It's good--note the 4 stars.  It's just not as good as it could've been.  There's genuine emotion behind such tunes as ""She Gets Me,"" ""Kiss Me When I'm Down,"" ""We Fly By Night,"" etc., but it never quite reaches the level it should.  Allan is in fine form throughout, whether he's rocking (the charging ""That Ain't Gonna Fly,"" the title track), or dipping into ballad territory (""Today,"" ""No Regrets"").

Allan and co-producers Mark Wright and Greg Droman lay the strings on a little too thick in spots; stellar songs such as ""I Think I've Had Enough"" and ""Today"" suffer to a degree from this.  There's a definite power pop/rock leaning here, which isn't as bad a thing as it sounds--Allan has the heart, voice, and guts to pull it off.  It makes you kind of miss the honky-tonk of his first two releases, and the bluesy traditional country of SMOKE RINGS...but we're really splitting hairs here.  GET OFF ON THE PAIN is far from Allan's best, but damned if it isn't a heart-felt country/rock record, far, far superior to what else is out there these days.","Gary Allan is one of the few saving graces left in country music . and age of auto - tuned superstars , it is nice to see a country rocker who likes it rough and imperfect .

A92F571Y9MTW6,B0083WM9F6,1,1,4,"Although it's hard to fathom, but Eric Benet has been in the business for two decades. He originally got his start by singing with his sister Lisa Jordan in a duo called Benet. When that project didn't go anywhere, Eric went on to do other things. He lended his talents as a background singer on Michael Franks' 1993 album ""Dragonfly Summer"", which lead to him signing with Franks' label Warner Bros. Records. While recording his debut, he endured the tragedy of his girlfriend dying in a car accident. In 1996, he released his debut ""True To Myself"", which featured the quiet storm favorites ""Let's Stay Together"" and ""Femininity"". Three years later, he issued his most successful album to date ""A Day In The Life"". It spawned two hits- the Toto remake ""Georgy Porgy"" and the Tamia duet ""Spend My Life With You"". While he was recording his next album, his career suffered another setback: His album ""Better And Better"" ended up being shelved. In its place, he released ""Hurricane"", an album that was mostly produced by soft rock mavens David Foster and Walter Afanasieff. He got back on track with 2008's ""Love & Life"" and released what came to be his final recording for Warner Bros., 2010's ""Lost In Time"".

In 2012, Eric Benet released his latest recording ""The One"". It's his first album for the EMI Records label who distributes his imprint Jordan House. On this album, he reunites with his longtime producers Demonte Posey and George Nash, Jr.- the same producers behind ""True To Myself"", ""Love & Life"", ""Lost In Time"" and roughly half of ""A Day In The Life"". He starts the album off with the uptempo ""Harriet Jones"", where he pines for the return of a lost love. He channels the sound of Maze featuring Frankie Beverly on the ballad ""News For You"" and celebrates the concept of finding happiness on ""Real Love"". He sings about his once neverending search for Mrs. Right on ""Runnin'"" and gets help from Lil' Wayne on the potentially controversial ""Redbone Girl"". He experiments with a couple of other genres, such as reggae on the Shaggy featured ""Hope That It's You"", jazz on the innuendo laced ""Come Together"" and country music on the hidden bonus track ""Come Home To Me"". He also makes a couple of references to his two daughters on ""The One"". He duets with his oldest daughter India on the song ""Muzik"" and sings about his newborn on ""Here In My Arms (Lucia's Lullaby)"". Overall, Eric Benet's ""The One"" is a strong recording from the neo-soul stalwart. While he does step out of his comfort zone on a few songs, he still sticks to what he does best.","Although it is hard to fathom , He lended his talents as a background singer on Michael Franks ' 1993 album "" Dragonfly Summer "" , which lead to him signing with Franks ' label Warner Bros.

They possess a keen sense of timing, excellent diction and sophisticated phrasing that invariably leaves me wanting more--and this CD is no exception!

There aren't too many tracks on this album which is a follow-up (Volume 2) of ""Six Pack;"" but everything we get here is top notch, high quality control singing and performing all the way through. ""Get Ready"" is quite dynamic and Straight No Chaser performs this with lots of energy right from their hearts and souls. It all works well, too--I love the sounds of their version of this song! ""Like a Prayer,"" a song I first heard by Madonna, gets the royal treatment from Straight No Chaser and I really like this number. Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"" (mixed with ""Poison"") shows their ability to do a two song medley with panache and listen for yet another gem of a two song medley with ""Rhythm of Love/Can't Help Falling in Love."" ""Buddy Holly"" is most impressive and the album ends strong with ""Let's Get It On."" Awesome!

Straight No Chaser again proves they have the vocal chops to remain a fine a cappella group for however long they wish to be performing together--and hopefully for us that will be many years to come! I highly recommend this album.","Straight No Chaser always impresses me with their incredible ability to deliver a cappella renditions of classic songs and ballads -- they put their own stamp on them with their remarkable harmonizing and the members of the group never miss a beat !

A1RJD10TTI568L,B004CT4I2Q,1,1,5,"Herman's Hermits were nearly as successful as The Beatles and The Stones in the sixties and also made the American breakthrough. They had a knack for hummable, melodic tunes and they featured in a movie or two that I saw as a kid (Ms Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter was one of those movie hits, the daughter in question being the puppy of a racing dog if I remember correctly!). What set them apart, was the lovely harmony vocals and the British accent; unlike most, they never affected an American or even mid-Atlantic accent in their catchy music. This excellent collection includes all of their greatest hits, taking the listener down memory lane to revisit the innocence of the 60s with glorious pop songs like I'm Into Something Good, Sleepy Joe and humorous ditties like I'm Hennery The Eighth I Am. My personal favourites include No Milk Today, There's A Kind Of Hush, My Sentimental Friend, Years May Come, Years May Go and Lady Barbara. I suppose they were considered a teenybop band and therefore weren't taken as seriously as some of their contemporaries, but time has been kind to their music - compared to a lot of today's chart stuff, this is a classic, timeless sound. This album will appeal to everyone who loves clever, tuneful pop performed with feeling and intelligence.","Herman 's Hermits were nearly as successful as The Beatles and also made the American breakthrough . that I saw as a kid ( Ms Brown You have Got A Lovely Daughter was one of those movie hits , the daughter in question being the puppy of a racing dog if I remember correctly ! ) .

A2N6LVH039X81N,B00GUN3GUM,1,1,5,"There are now a whole bunch of classical Christmas mp3s on Amazon that offer a hundred or more tracks of Xmas favorites for about a buck. Several of these are pretty good, but this is one with a difference--and one you shouldn't miss. What makes this album special is the rich concentration of important and beautiful choral works found within its nearly 10 hours and 192 tracks. Many of this pieces are very hard to find, and given that most of these recordings must date from the 1950s or 1960s, the sound is remarkably good. Performance standard are consistently high, with beautiful solo singing and choral ensembles.
Unfortunately amazon gives us no composer names, so it's not easy to know what you're getting. After some research, I can provide at least a partial list of some of the complete choral works on this album. Starting with track numbers, these include:
1. Jean Mouton - Noe, Noe, Psallite Noe
2. Anonymous (Gregorian Chant) - Veni Redemptor Gentium; Balthasar Resinarius, Johann Eccard & Andreas Raselius - Nun komm der Heiden Heiland (4 settings)

Both Schtz works are gorgeous, as are the pieces by Buxtehude, Haydn, Caldara, Monteverdi, and the closing anthem by Purcell-- all of which were previously unknown to me. Helmut Rilling, who went on to record Bach's complete cantatas, is at the helm for several of these performances.
There are also selections from Handel's Messiah and Bach's Magnificat--and a few other Bach pieces-- scattered throughout the album (I would rather have seen them concentrated in one place).
I would strongly recommend this for the wonderful and hard to find choral works listed above. And the popular carols aren't bad either. I downloaded this a few hours ago and have been listening to it non-stop every since! Enjoy....","There are now a whole bunch of classical Christmas mp3s on Amazon or more tracks of Xmas favorites for about a buck . Several of these are pretty good , and one you should not miss . What makes this album special is the rich concentration of important and beautiful choral works found within its nearly 10 hours Many of this pieces are very hard to find , or 1960s , the sound is remarkably good . Performance standard are consistently high , with beautiful solo singing Unfortunately amazon gives us no composer names , so it is not easy to know what you are getting .

""I love you more than I have
Ever found a way to say to you

Next door, there's an old man who lived to his 90's
And one day, passed away in his sleep
And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days
And passed away

I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way
To tell you that I know we belong
That I know that I am
I am, I am the luckiest""","My sister sang a few verses of the song as part of her vows ... then this was their song for the first dance .

A2ATZD6LMZZV92,B00122OH0O,-1,-1,3,"Don't care for the re-master or the transfer of this recording.  It often automatically presumed that because a recording has been re-mastered, or transferred from analog to digital, that it's better.  Not so in many cases.  Re-mastering often over-compresses the original recording and results in the equivalent of a poor mix.  Subtleties in the background either disappear, or become so faint as to lose relevance to the song.

In the two Robert Plant songs that I downloaded ('Big Log' and 'In The Mood'), I found this to be the case.  Extremely disappointing.

While I think that the live performances were a shade better in sheer energy (there was a synergy between Jordan and the audience), these are perhaps a shade more well-done technically. What really comes through is Jordan's soaring voice and expressiveness. Just close your eyes and listen to the music. While I like them all, I think my favorite tracks are Great Is Thy Faithfulness, Hallelujah, Climb Every Mountain (perhaps colored by my memories of the show as I remember whispering ""Yes"" at the end of the powerful performance), and Mary Did You Know.

If you enjoy vocal performances, try out this recording. I don't think you will be disappointed.","I loved watching Jordan Smith on The Voice . that the live performances were a shade better in sheer energy ( there was a synergy between Jordan and the audience ) , these are perhaps a shade more well - done technically .

He has the combination of superb virtuoso technique, great tonal beauty, and strong intellect. I never find his playing boring or unexciting. The audience in Chicago always adores him and I hope we will contiue to see him frequently. These two discs are available at an incredible low price. If you enjoy Ax in Chopin please check out his Brahms concertos and late Brahms solo piano Opus 117-119. He has recorded a lot of chamber music with Ma. I would start with the Chopin disc which has the cello sonata and also includes the early trio with Frank on the violin. The Beethoven cello sonatas with Ma are also worth exploring.","I had the great pleasure of recently hearing Emanuel Ax in recital playing Chopin He has the combination of superb virtuoso technique , great tonal beauty , and strong intellect .

Founded in 1925 as a 5,000 watt station at the top of the AM dial, by 1960 WMCA adopted their successful ""Good Guys"" Top 40 format. Despite competition from 50,000 watt clear channel WABC-770, 'MCA was NYC's ratings champ from 1963 through '66. By 1970, they transitioned to an all talk format called ""Dial-Log Radio.""

NYC's PREMIER ALBUMS was founded in 1959 as a budget operation with such labels as CORONET and SPIN-O-RAMA. In 1965, Premier bought out Philly-based CAMEO/PARKWAY. Their JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY - A MEMORIAL ALBUM (#2099) is fine-quality: a substantial disc with good audio. The record reproduces in full a one-hour show narrated by Brown and broadcast over WMCA on the day of JFK's murder, 11/22/63. All but two speeches selected are excerpts.

The LP's back cover has the memorial service eulogy given by Cardinal Richard Cushing of Massachusetts, and the lying in state remarks of House Speaker John McCormack (of Boston), Chief Justice Earl Warren (former Gov. of CA.) and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (of MT.). Mansfield's comments were briefest, but also the most moving:

""There was a sound of laughter; in a moment, it
was no more. And so she took a ring from her finger
and placed it in his hands.
There was a husband who asked much and gave much,
and out of the giving and the asking wove with a
woman what could not be broken in life, and in a
moment it was no more. And so she took a ring from
her finger and placed it in his hands, and kissed him
and closed the lid of a coffin.
A piece of each of us died at that moment. Yet, in
death he gave of himself to us. He gave us of a good
heart from which the laughter came. He gave us of a
profound wit, from which a great leadership emerged.""

AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0011B6UI8,-1,-1,3,"Rick Springfield has been anything but bland, from his breakout ""Jessie's Girl"" to his previous release, SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE.  THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is, unfortunately, a largely bland effort.  Springfield is still at the top of his form as a picker (there are some excellent guitar riffs in here), but his voice has gotten worse (worked well on SDAA, but a raspy, spoken-voiced version of ""Imagine""?  Come on).

Therefore, this record will undoubtably not win Springfield any new fans, nor please his old ones (especially since it's a cover album, and he has only one original on here that doesn't measure up to his usual songwriting standards).  The main flaw of the record is this: Springfield relies heavily on the drum machines he criticized in his hit ""Human Touch.""  In fact, this sounds more like a pop record than a rock record, with the saxaphones keeping it from going into Brittany Spears territory.  And while most of the songs he chose are of great quality, and while a few of his performances shine (""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Miss You Nights"" specifically), THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is undeniably a let-down.  Maybe the album after this one will feature Springfield, if not in his finest vocal form, at least writing his own tunes again, and either making us swoon as in his 80s hits, or getting us pissed off as he did with SDAA.","but bland , from his breakout "" Jessie 's Girl "" to his previous release , SHOCK / DENIAL / ANGER / ACCEPTANCE .

AL5RFV0ZQ1IO9,B013CKV75G,1,1,5,"Best album since ""Promised Land"" I've been a QR fan since the very beginning and this is one of my faves, all the songs are catchy and infectious
Right from the Opener ""Arrow of Time"" to the progressive closer ""Condition Human"" this album has every element of a Classic QR album.
Superb chrouses , excellent guitar work by Michael Wilton ( aka Whip) and Parker Lundren.
superb bass and singing by Eddie ""Bass"" Jackson , Scott Rockenfield's drumming is always a highlight for me one of the best drummers in the business.
and of course Todd LaTorre, not only is Todd a Humble guy but an awesome musician in every aspect. I must say if you really listen to this album he makes it his own , there is no ""Clone"" here just pure kick ass vocals and great lyrics!

The last album was very good, but this one takes it up a notch, and the production is superb! ( I know many people complained about the last one being over compressed)
 Zeuss (Chris Zeuss Harris)  out did himself on this getting the best for the band!

I don't feel there is one filler on this album, even the ballad ""Just Us"" is incredible.

My top 5 faves though are:
1) The Aftermath /Condition Human
2) Hellfire
3) eye9
4) Bulletproof
5) All There Was

This is a ""Must have"" for all classic Queensryche fans! and even for those who love great Melodic Metal/Rock with Progressive elements thrown in.
I hear they are already writing songs for the next album! Hoping they continue for yrs to come! \m/

Angel

By Sarah McLachlan

Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay

There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard, at the end of the day

I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins

And maybe empty
Oh, and weightless, and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back

The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack

It don't make no difference
Escape one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
Oh, this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here","Sarah does such an amazing job on this song . Beautiful , beautiful song . Angel For that second chance that second chance For a break that would make it okay To feel not good enough And it is hard , at the end of the day

But for his latest single, Blame It, the second single from his 3rd album Intuition, feels honestly more like a lackluster vibe than imagined. I sadly didn't feel it was a driven R&B song that hit the nail on the head, unlike recent tracks from Solange', Kanye West, or others that've been strong on the soul. I do hope though for Jamie that he can find better music for himself, and I definitely hope that he can be really start all over by making peace with his feelings about what Hannah Montana would show.

Perhaps the first group in this scene to break through to the mainstream during this era was Toronto, Ontario's Sum 41, who began recording their second release and the album being reviewed, ""All Killer, No Filler"", in October of Y2K, just as Green Day were clearly moving on to pastures anew.

Wow!  Talk about this record being a return to form for punk!  After a mood-setting intro, on track number two ""Nothing On My Back,"" the listener is introduced to the band's striking, distinctive, and razor-sharp guitar sound, which was equal parts traditional punk-rock reverb and equal parts pure attitude.  It is a guitar tone that is truly raw, inspired, and decidedly ""old school"" -- and was indeed copied ten times over by acts that would follow.  Often imitated, but never duplicated, because no one ever did it again like Sum did.

And yet, on this same opener, it is made clear that the group also have the tunes to back it up, and then some!  From vocalist/co-guitarist Deryck Whibley's ultra-memorable vocal lines and defiant sneer to bassist Cone's well-placed and twanging mid-song interlude, these guys prove they're the real deal, and it doesn't let up from there.  This cut segues into the 50-second ""Never Wake Up,"" which is a fast and furious monster and as good of a take on hardcore punk as any I've heard.  The two best songs, though, lie in the disc's second half.  One is ""Summer,"" a rerecording from the group's debut ""Half Hour of Power,"" and boy, is it a masterpiece!  The main driving force in it is a simple, three-chord progression, but it proves that sometimes the simplest riffing can also be the most effective.  And that chorus -- you will not get it out of your head for days!  No doubt, one of Sum's signature tunes.  Perhaps my all-time favorite, though, is track number ten, ""Crazy Amanda Bunkface.""  This one is two minutes and 16 seconds of pure punk rock bliss, and Deryck's raging guitar solo, which is somewhat reminiscent of Green Day's earlier ""Haushinka,"" will surely have you cranking the sound to maximum levels and basking in the euphoria.  Again, a cut virtually unrivalled in the confines of punk.

And there you have it -- 32 minutes of great music, with absolutely no boring spots anywhere to be found, that will surely have you putting ""All Killer, No Filler"" on repeat.  I know there was a time in the mid-2000s that I used to air this album in its entirety daily, and almost exactly 15 years on from its release, it hasn't dated one bit or lost its power to enthrall you.  I want to add that I'm 41 (incidentally) and have been listening to underground punk rock (Dead Kennedys, Government Issue, the F.U.'s, et al) for decades, and I still think that ""All Killer, No Filler"" is among the best-crafted punk LPs in my collection, with perhaps the highest replay value of them all.  A masterpiece that started a wave of imitators...

ALND45MWBGUQS,B00LB8OYHU,1,1,4,"Six years after their last album of original material, Counting Crows are back. Somewhere Under Wonderland is a solid comeback for the band, even if it feels slightly disconnected at the seams.

Palisades Park is an ambitious opener, complete with a jazzy intro and shifting dynamics. The band still has the ability to take an eight minute song and make it feel completely effortless. Frontman Adam Duritz can still weave an engrossing story as tracks like John Appleseed's Lament and the rock-flavored Dislocation clearly demonstrate. The aggressive tones of Dislocation and Elvis Went to Hollywood recall some of the band's earlier work on records like Recovering the Satellites, yet it's the folk-driven narratives of God of Ocean Tides, Scarecrow and Cover Up the Sun that really steal the show. Most of these tracks recall stories of traveling and life on the road, giving the record an undercurrent of dislocation and late nights spent between cities It's an interesting concept and Duritz pulls it off wonderfully, complete with the beautiful closer Possibility Days.

While the songs are mostly solid, I can't help feeling that they lack some cohesion. The record features a nice blend of styles but the country tracks are so good that I almost wish the band had just stripped down and gone for a full-blown folk album. The individual songs are quite good but there's also nothing quite as poignant as Amy Hit the Atmosphere or Rain King. Adam's voice and lyrics are as strong as ever but at only nine tracks the album feels a bit too brief; another two or three songs would have rounded it out nicely. These are minor points that are easy to overlook when the strength of the songs themselves is kept in focus.

In spite of that, Somewhere Under Wonderland is a refreshing return for one of my favorite bands. Despite a couple of hiccups this is a fun release that gets better with every spin and gives me hope that Duritz and his bandmates will continue to weave more tales for quite some time.","Six years after their last album of original material , Counting Crows are back .

Just looking at the cover photos I gather that his decision to include his self in various ""life stages"" and then, listening to this lp, I can confidently assume that Jeff feels this work embodies all of who he is and his life's work until now.

If your a fan of any of his former bands, work, you need to pick this one up!

A92F571Y9MTW6,B00YHTO1HS,1,1,4,"Electro-pop singer Ashley Nicolette Frangipane was born in Washington, New Jersey to a Black father and a White mother. The contrast in tastes of music (Her father: Hip hop, her mother; Alternative rock) would form the basis of who she is as an artist. Coming from humble beginnings, the singer watched as her parents struggled to make ends meet, as they were minors at the time of her birth. As a teenager, she became well versed in playing the violin as well as the acoustic guitar. However, she became a musician full time to make ends meet. She then chose the moniker Halsey, which was an alternate spelling of her first name and filmed doing cover songs on YouTube and posting original songs on Soundcloud. The latter gave her attention from record labels, to which she signed to the Virgin Records' alternative label Astralwerks Records - the same label responsible for The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim and Empire Of The Sun. In 2014, she released her EP ""Room 93"" and went on tour with the British band The Kooks as an opening act. Almost a year after she released her EP, she released her debut album ""Badlands"" which featured production from the likes of Tim Anderson, Lido, The Futuristics, Swedish producer Yung Gud and the trio Captain Cuts, among others.

Musically, her album is rooted in the current sounds of edgy pop music with frequent nods to 80's indie. Thematically, the concept revolves around a fictional dystopian society called The Badlands - a desert wasteland where the survivors and natives were imprisoned. She begins the project with ""Castle"", where she enters a progressing society despite being chained. Halsey also tries to keep her head up admist the face of adversity and opposition on ""Hold Me Down"". On the first single ""New Americana"", she celebrates the diversity of the millennial generation, while working in a reference to Mtume's 1983 hit ""Juicy Fruit"". On the ballad ""Drive"", she speaks of a couple who have deep feelings for each other but are very careful not to make the first move and respond with silence. ""Hurricane"" is an autobiographical song that tells of her brief romance with an older man in her native New York during her teenage years. She finds an escape from her problems and desires to find happiness somewhere else on ""Roman Holiday"", while being done with an indifferent lover on ""Ghost"". She deals with someone on a path to self-destruction on ""Colors"" and continues the storyline on ""Coming Down"". Overall, ""Badlands"" is a good recording from Halsey. Although the production could have been a little better, in the end the songs are quite catchy and surprisingly upbeat for an indie pop act. Given the success of her debut, there may be a chance to hear more from her.","Coming from humble beginnings , the singer watched as her parents struggled to make ends meet , as they were minors at the time of her birth .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00124HVBO,1,1,4,"There are just so many hits collections that realy seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists. That has always been the case with love songs collections as well, because there are just so many of them that really don't seem to showcase enough material that really reflects the best of those love songs. That just isn't the case with Chicago, and their great music collections, because they definitely hit the nail of the head very, very well. Their music has endured extraordinarily well for over thirty-five years. There have been a few successful hits collections that really reflects Chicago, and this one is just no acception.

Chicago's 2005 Love Songs collection, consists of their most well recieved love songs from thier long-time career. The album conists of 18 tracks, and a couple of live rendidtions of classics never before released on any Chicago album as well. The collection contains a lot of great tracks inclding You're The Inspiration, Will You Still Love Me, Beginnings, as well as classics like Colour My World Hard Habit To Break, and Hard To Say I'm Sorry. The album also includes a couple of live recording with Phillip Bailey from Earth, Wind & Fire fame, on versions of If You Leave Me Now, and the Earth, Wind & Fire classic, After The Love Is Gone, which really sounds delightful and lively.

While there love songs albums that really don't sell very well, or just miss out on a lot of great songs, Chicago's Love Songs really displays very, very well within not just its price, but the vast number of classic Chicago tracks here. While many not at all be interested in this collection, it really is a good reflection of Chicago's best ballads.

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000W11NDU,-1,-1,3,"Remember back in 1996 when everyone came back to New Edition for their reunion album? Then Bobby Brown said he could make more money by himself, and everyone said he was coming off too cocky. Well, Johnny Gill released a new solo album at the same time New Edition's Home Again came out, so wasn't he being a little cocky himself? Yeah, everyone knows Johnny can do his thing solo, but to be honest, this wasn't his best album.
Take the Babyface-penned title track, for example. The song sounds fine until you get to the chorus: ""Let's get the mood right/Turn on your heart light."" Turn on your heart light? That's too cheesy, even for Babyface. And ""Love In An Elevator"" is full of corny lyrics like ""They say there's no luck on the thirteenth floor/But I found love and so much more"" and ""Like The Staples, I wanna take you there."" ""Simply Say I Love You"" is okay, but the album said Stevie Wonder is featured in this song. Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember hearing Stevie in that song.
The only songs that really stand out are ""Maybe"" and ""It's Your Body"". The latter features Roger Troutman, and we all know that slow Roger Troutman songs are irresistible. The thing that really brings the other slow songs down is that they all talk about the same thing: sex, sex, and more sex. The sleepy production doesn't make things better, either.
Another problem on this album are the corny uptempo songs, especially the very last track, ""So Gentle"". It features a rap from Ron DeVoe, so you know what the main problem is. But the thing is that the preceding song ""I Know You Want Me"" features uninspired rapping from some other guy, and his rapping is actually worse than Ron's.
I still like Johnny Gill, but this album seems like it was rushed. And the strong adlibs he's known for usually adds feeling to the songs, but here it seems like they're trying to hide the questionable material. You're better off getting the solo albums he made before this.","and everyone said he was coming off too cocky .

"" "" Simply Say I Love You "" is okay , but the album said Stevie Wonder is featured in this song . that slow Roger Troutman songs are irresistible . that really brings the other slow songs down is The sleepy production does not make things better , either . Another problem on this album are the corny uptempo songs , especially the very last track , "" So Gentle "" . It features a rap from Ron DeVoe , so you know what the main problem is . that the preceding song "" I Know You Want Me "" features uninspired rapping from some other guy , and his rapping is actually worse than Ron 's . I still like Johnny Gill , but this album seems like it was rushed . And the strong adlibs he is known for usually adds feeling to the songs , but here it seems like they are trying to hide the questionable material . You are better off getting the solo albums he made before this ."

A300AR4IM0KW21,B0014HVZX4,1,1,5,"The Black Angels' debut ""Passover"" was an exciting surge back to 60s psychedelia, full of mind-bending drones, trippy guitars and a truly inspired vocalist in Alex Maas. ""Direction To See A Ghost"" continues things in the same vein. Granted there isn't much new to TBA's sound, but this doesn't bother me. They have such a distinguished sound already that varying it too much after just two releases was never necessary.

As with the debut, the songs tend to flow and groove endlessly. The `drone machine' saturates everything, the drums are powerful and locked, the guitar tone is perfectly fuzzy and Maas' piercing, nasally delivery is wonderfully fitting. Some songs have the tendency to drift on, but there are some real gems here. The one-two punch of ""You On The Run"" and ""Doves"" is a grand opening, with the former setting up a brooding, melancholy Velvet Underground atmosphere, only for the latter to cut through with some feel-good, sunshine pop psychedelia. Other highlights include the sombre ""18 Years"" and the sitar-laden ""Deer-Ree-Shee"". Generally, there isn't a bad song to be found here. ""Directions"" is another great album from The Black Angels that firmly cements them at the forefront of modern psychedelic rock.","The Black Angels ' debut "" Passover "" was an exciting surge back to 60s psychedelia , full of mind - bending drones , trippy guitars and a truly inspired vocalist in Alex Maas .

A2TX79GR278JMA,B004BTGX8E,-1,-1,1,"I have heard this song a lot lately, in various stores and pumping through the loudspeakers at the gym before I turn on my ipod. It sounds like something that was designed by a committee to hit that perfect combination of catchy, trendy and completely inoffensive. Somehow it's also gratingly annoying and sticks in your (your here being ""my"") head for days after it's been heard. It's worse than ""It's A Small World After All."" Perhaps it's the familiarity of the ""Time Of My Life"" lyric that adds the hook, because the rest is comprised of a startlingly unoriginal dance track with generic lyrics about losing control on the dance floor and being freaky freaky, etc., which should, in theory, just blend in with the rest of the background noise. I might just walk out of the next store where I hear this playing if I am near the exit and don't have a full cart of groceries which I will have to abandon.

Nena's 99 Luftballons was one my favorite songs and the English version was played on the local radio, though the song had special meaning to me because I took German in High School, and I heard the song in German. While I was driving through Norway's beautiful Lofoten Islands I came across 3 young Swiss backpackers hitch hiking along the side of the road. They had to get to Moskenes and hop on a ferry to get to Bodos (Norwegian mainland). Given the time of day, I realized I had to just drive them to the ferry terminal or they would have to camp in the cold Norwegian night. Along the drive the 3 Swiss students translated the German version of the Nena's 99 Luftballon into English for me. They were a Swiss German speakers so they did not fully understand what Nena was saying, but he German version is lot more interesting. The German version has nothing to with 99 red balloons. Rather it is about mis-identifying 99 air balloons (weather balloons) which lead to 99 years of war. German artists are so avant garde, like Mike Myer's Dieter.","and I had purchased 4 of my favorite songs from the 1980s from Amazon Prime to listen to while I drove through the scenic roads of Northern Norway .

They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from _Everything_ (though this is by no means _All Over The Place_, Volume 2).
I am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's ""Nickel Romeo,"" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susannah sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (""Something That You Said"", ""I Will Take Care of You"", ""Grateful""). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days--for example, the two bonus tracks on this album, both sides of the Bangles' first single. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances, period, on ""Ask Me No Questions"" and ""Here Right Now,"" and Vicki sounds great on ""Single by Choice,"" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's ""I Am A Rock."" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on ""Mixed Messages""? As for ""The Rain Song,"" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan!
The ensemble vocals on ""Ride the Ride"" and ""Stealing Rosemary"" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is top-notch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch.
My only criticism of this album is that it's a bit long. Not all of these songs are essential--I might have shortened 'Doll Revolution' by dropping ""Lost at Sea,"" ""Song for a Good Son,"" and ""Between the Two.""
I understand some of these songs have been floating around for years--indeed, some have been recorded and released before--so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album, if there is one, can measure up to 'Doll Revolution'.

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000W11N6W,1,1,5,"One crucial element that sets this apart from her debut&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Acoustic-Soul/dp/B00005A1PR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Acoustic Soul</a>&nbsp;a year earlier is that...somehow the sound is very much more fully formed in many ways. Wheras the sound of the debut generally emphasized the artists ""naturalness"" this blends India's ""acoustic soul"" sound with a array of soundscapes,many of which are as equally funky and soulful.""Little Things"" is an excellent example. It's groove,the heavy-on-easy style and unique chord changes could only come from the guy who produced her debut:Stevie Wonder. Just about all of the music here maintains his signiture writing style as well,even though India is more fully in charge of the production here. The lyrics are typically ""power of positive thinking"" but the wonderful thing about them is that India's great attitude and the sincerity and brilliance of her poetry really forgive any possibility for a clishe. Needless the say the moments when this album really catches fire are when the tempo goes up a little such as on the excellent ""Slow Down"",""Can I Walk With You"" and the bonus cut ""Interested""-all rollicking soul tunes then endow her formula with a lot of rhythmic strengh. Of course that doesn't dismiss the respectful tone of ""Talk To You"",""Complicated Melody"" and ""Headed In The Right Direction"". The only song that confuses me a little here,where I love the lush music is ""God Is Real"". I realize the connection in the black community to Christianity runs deep and is significant but for the life of me I cannot tell if this song is advertising India's obvious Christian faith or if her intention is to point out that nature in itself is godly. Not being religious myself these kinds of ambiguous lyrics are always mildly curious to me. So while this album really serves mostly to establish that her huge success with the debut wasn't some kind of post millenium fluke this was really the last time,musically anyway India. Arie would have anything to prove.","which are as equally funky and soulful . ""Little Things "" is an excellent example .

A2XKQHB8VCUCJK,B00382MONS,1,-1,3,"The final American album from Johnny Cash isn't his strongest, but it's one of his most memorable. It's not his strongest because he wasn't feeling his strongest. These songs were recorded just weeks and months before his passing. His whispers are haunting though, on tracks like ""Ain't No Grave,"" because he obviously understands that his life is coming to an end.

I'm not familiar with a lot of these songs, and to be honest, I wish there were more songs here for Johnny to sing. I don't think his version of ""Aloha Oe"" will be remembered as one of his greatest recordings ever, so the album feels a little too light, but maybe that's the point.

If you are a fan of Johnny Cash's American recordings, I recommend listening to the album, and if you are thrilled by what you hear, then buy the album. If you are new to Johnny's music, I would start somewhere else.","The final American album from Johnny Cash is not his strongest , but it is one of his most memorable .

AZSN1TO0JI87B,B005MVLI8A,1,1,5,"Everyone in the world has an opinion on Nirvana. It's basically split down the middle: Either you love them or you hate them. Regardless of how you feel about Nirvana, one thing is certain: Nevermind has been the subject of over-analyzation by music critics for years.
You've heard the story millions of times. Nevermind came out at a time when music was in a very sorry state. The 90's had just begun and the world was trying to move away from all the hair-metal bands of the nineties that had become such a stale cliche (Much like the nu-metal bands of late). Indeed, Nevermind completely changed the story of music and paved the way for countless bands of the 90's to follow and started a style that today, still refuses to die. But everyone blabbers on about how thoughtful and insightful this album is and about how Kurt Cobain was this great poet. Nothing could be shorter of the truth. The True beauty behind Nevermind is in it's simplicity. People realized that you can just have great stripped down music without all the dramatics. Don't think for a minute I am diminising the quality of this album. I'm just simply saying, everyone loves it for all the wrong reasons. The bottom line is, good music is good music. If it sounds good, it is good, nothing more to it, and Nevermind is an album that confirms that.
I think it is obvious that this album has and will continue to stand the test of time. I myself have bought 3 copies of it since it's release (My first cassette tape of it, a CD that got worn out, and the copy I now own). Pretty much 1 out of every 5 people in the country own this. You can't throw a cat in a room full of people and not hit an owner of this album. It's effected so many people and has definetly earned it's ""Essential Recording"" label.","It is basically split down the middle : Either you love them or you hate them .

AJK5WHV1GW941,B0015Q383O,1,1,4,"Trina released a very enjoyable album for April Fool's Day 2008!  I thought her debut was decent, but not at all groundbreaking, so I thought this album would be along the lines of her debut, but oh no!  It's a lot better.  ""Still Da Baddest"" is definitely a solid album.  Trina is still talking about sex, how pretty she is (and she is pretty), how great her sex is, and she reminds us that she's still ""da baddest b****.""  Ironically, though, when I read her interviews, she does not come off as b****y at all.  She seems to be a very kind, gentle and mature woman.  I know there is another side, but it's nice to know that she is a sweetheart beneath the sassiness.

 Up-beat tunes and good lyrics fill this album.  Trina's delivery is as energetic and confident as ever, and trust me, you will be dancing and/or snapping at some point when listening to this album.  Sure, this album is on the experimental side and Trina's voice serves as an annoyance because it is unusually high-pitched  sometimes, but, as a unit, rap fans should be entertained by this LP.  ""Single Again"" was the album's first release.  The catchy hook will really help you get into this song, particularly its melody. Also, this is one of Trina's best songs lyrically.  She apparently sat down and thought this song out before penning it.  Nice beat, too.  Trina is a product of Miami and it was a nice touch for her to speak with a southern drawl on ""Killing You H***.""  In this song, Trina informs her listener that she is hot and these other women aren't on her level nor are they doing anything for her.  Again, the beat is nice and the hook is alright as well.  Pitbull lends his talents on ""Stop Traffic.""  His voice is so easy to listen to and he adds flavor to the song.  Every song on this album is at least decent, therefore, you can press play and listen to it from track one to track twelve.

 Trina is definitely improving as a rapper.  This is a really nice LP and is recommended by me.  Continue progressing, Trina.  You have a supporter in me.

AV648VU7JR5D5,B002YSOVWE,1,1,5,"One of my mellow faves. As close and light as I dare get to brushing up against something like Elton John's 'Your Song' or Rita Coolidge's 'We're All Alone'. If You Could Read My Mind includes a folky air of mystic dreaminess and presents a romantic honesty without flying off into Sapland. The music is pretty subdued, nice acoustic guitars and the use of one of my favorite techniques, the gently rising, unobtrusive string arrangement. Then there's Gord's voice, so soft and comfortable, like a perfectly worn baseball mitt. I also like that the lyrics don't always rhyme in the places where you think they should. It's a Dear Jane letter, the writer trying to explain why he is no longer in love, and having a hard time understanding it himself. Lots of cool images - a ghost from a wishing well, a fortress strong, a paperback novel from the drugstore, an old-time movie.

There are many different photos of Gordon Lightfoot out there...I prefer the rugged curly haired mustachioed mid 70s AM radio adult contemporary Gord's Gold version.","and light as I dare get to brushing up against something like Elton John 's ' Your Song ' or Rita Coolidge 's ' We are All Alone ' . and presents a romantic honesty without flying off into Sapland .

A1IY5CJK0LMC71,B00BG59OIM,-1,1,4,"I've never been a fan of Disturbed. From the first time I heard David Draiman say muahahah in the radio hit song ""Down With the Sickness,"" I have not found a Disturbed track that didn't sound cheesy, for lack of a better word. That is why I was so surprised to find out that Draiman is the voice behind Device. I listened to the clips of the songs on Amazon before I read the reviews, so I was already interested in the music before the relation to Disturbed could turn me off. Speaking of the music, it is very heavy. Some reviewers have commented on the industrial aspects of the album, but any similarities between True industrial and Device end at the processed drums and guitars and a few synth noises. If you told a fan of KMFDM that Device was industrial, they would probably laugh at you. Of course, I don't care for KMFDM or True industrial, so Device's industrial-lite metal is okay with me. I was initially drawn to the album by the album's heaviness and Draiman's voice. Without knowing who was singing, I thought the singer was topnotch. Now that I own the album and know that the singer is David Draiman of Disturbed, I am going to go back and give Disturbed's catalog another listen. I do have one issue with what I consider an otherwise great album. Sadly, Device is seriously lacking in guitar leads. In place of leads, Draiman has inserted a number of melodic bridges into the songs. I'm not sure why he chose not to include leads in his songs; they would only have added to the music, but perhaps, being a singer, he saw the parts of the songs where leads would normally be as an opportunity to highlight his vocal abilities. All in all, the album is an enjoyable listen. I would recommend it to fans of all kinds of heavy music from Sevendust and Drowning Pool to Soilwork and Scar Symmetry.","I have never been a fan of Disturbed .

AXPYGNIC5ZIXS,B001QP9FWC,1,1,4,"In the mid-90's Alanis Morissette's angry alternative rock struck a chord with many, and ""Jagged Little Pill"" went on to become the biggest-selling debut album of all time by a female artist. Of course, not all of us were anxious to have a 22-year-old girl tell us just how ticked off she was about this, that, or the other. And for whatever fans ""Pill"" didn't make, its followup, ""Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,"" with its lone hit ""Thank U,"" didn't exactly sway the vote either. However her third offering, ""Under Rug Swept,"" seems poised to expand her fan base.
For starters, she's not just asserting honest emotions this time, but a distinct artistry as well. She produced the set herself, and power pop guru Glen Ballard seems nowhere to be found; Alanis instantly dispells any notion that will harm things, however, as the irresistible leadoff track ""21 Things I Want in a Lover"" proves she's ready to reclaim a spot in radio. The album's actual first single, ""Hands Clean,"" is just as sharp and catchy, and, like the equally hit-ready ""Precious Illusions,"" even though the lyrics tell of a love gone wrong, she isn't so much telling the guy off as she is expressing reactions. Through it all, the sound is still a powerful one but the edges are ever so slightly rounded off; a subtlely more feminine approach that Ballard never offered her.  Perhaps part of the reason for this is, without Ballard to produce and co-write, some of Morissette's influences are coming through stronger, such as Sarah McLachlan and The Sundays.
But her growth isn't found solely in production. ""A Man"" offers a slow-burning, pulsating rock groove over a compellingly spiritual lyric, while ""Utopia"" finds her singing sweetly in a Sarah McLachlan-ish register over a chorus of acoustic guitars about her ideas of how to make the world a better place. Both songs are unfortunately uncommercial but also provide irresistible listens. And ""That Particular Time,"" with its haunting piano and elegant melody, clearly shows an artist in evolution.
But to see how far she has truly come, one has to listen to no more than the achingly gorgeous ballad ""Flinch."" Sounding deceptively simple, Alanis uses a beautiful acoustic melody to lament a love affair she just can't get over. In the song, some time has apparently gone by since the breakup, and she mentions her brother running into the ex, singing ""I'd be paralyzed if I ran into you/my tongue would sieze up if we were to meet again."" Had this been ""Jagged Little Pill,"" she probably would have asked her brother where he saw the guy so she could be sure to run into him on purpose. But now Alanis opens up her emotional accessibility so far as to let us see a vulnerable, and therefore beautiful, resigned sadness. It's bravery like this, without the need to scream it in our face as she once did, that makes the album so impressive. In the same song, Alanis sings, ""some day I'll grow up,"" but what makes ""Under Rug Swept"" such a compelling listen is the fact that her maturity has clearly already begun.","In the mid-90 's Alanis Morissette 's angry alternative rock struck a chord with many , and "" Jagged Little Pill "" went on to become the biggest - selling debut album of all time by a female artist .

After viewing the videos, it would have been nice to see the mini-movie that was oringally planned for the album. I can only think of one compliant with the album and that's the digipack, but other than that, Ne-Yo has produced another fine album and I can't wait for the tour.
-- Track By Track--
1. Champagne Life - The second single no explanation necessary. **** out of ****

2. Makin' A Movie - Ne-Yo has always provided some sexy slow jams on his albums and this is no expectation. **** out of ****

3. Know Your Name  - This is another  smooth slow that compliments the former track very well. I could easily see this video taking place after Champagne Life and before One In A Million. *** out of ****.

4. Telekinesis - Another sexy slow jam t completes a trilogy of slow jams.  **** out of ****

5. Crazy Love feat. Fabolous - As a preview reviewer said Fab, spits a nice verse in this song and considering this is the sixth track that the two have done together, I'm sure that they could make an album together that would be very nice. **** out of ****.

6. One In A Million - The third single where Ne-Yo shows off his rapping skills. Much credit is given as Ne-Yo never goes into the territory of a singer trying to be a rapper. **** out of ****.

7. Genuine Only - Every Ne-Yo album has a filler song and this is the song on this album. I would have loved to have the slow jam Chillin on the album instead of this one. ** out of ****.

8. Cause I Said So - This is the only song other than Beautiful Monster, I don't really care of. I think it's a bit too much on the pop side. ** out of ****

9. Beautiful Monster - I didn't really care for this song when I first heard it and I still don't. However the video is very creative. ** out of ****

10. What Have I Done?  - The perfect way to close out the album and the storyline of Jerome & Pretti Sincliar. It's a somber ballad about heartbreak. **** out of ****","The album is full of the slow jams and music designed to make you feel good .

A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000W20FY2,1,1,5,"During my MTV days, Steve Winwood's big 80's splash with songs from Back In The High Life didn't go unnoticed by me.  After discovering that album and Chronicles, I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver, which I copied.  My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat ""While You See A Chance.""  Winwood's sweeping organ-like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit-it reached #7 in 1981-along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio-friendly beat, with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing.  I find myself enjoying this song more than ""Higher Love.""

The title track reached #48 on the singles chart, a slower midpaced affair.  ""Spanish Dancer"" along the same languid lines, may be an example of what many called ""lazy music"" to describe Winwood's early solo stuff.  This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life.

I wonder why ""Second-Hand Woman"" wasn't a chart-topper, as it's a more lively affair with Winwood's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat.  Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being ""a slot machine to take my dime"" but it is quite the danceable track.  The same holds True for the near eight minute on-the-run opus ""Night Train"" with its funky beats mixed with guitars, particularly a solo around the six minute mark, and the usual keyboards.  A single mix of this could've done well, but alas.

Two non-singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs.  They are ""Slowdown Sundown.""  A wistful ballad, calling wine that ""glassful of memories""  and something to soothe the balm of yesterday's pain.  The tempo goes up during the bridge, which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life.  The closing track ""Dust"" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away, in this case meaning time with a woman, yet how to deal with a love that's gone, but a friendship that still remains?  Indeed, ""a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing,"" meaning time, ""the universal healer.""  That brings to mind the Dr. Who quote ""the sands of time wash us all clean.""

Mellow, but not ""lazy music"" as was described by some, Arc Of A Diver shows that Winwood still had some life in him following Traffic.  Considering the turn-of-the-decade changes going on in the music scene, i.e. punk and new wave, it's fortunate that Arc found an audience.  And Winwood played all the instruments on the album, much like Prince had done his own debut For You.  Despite having only seven songs, Arc benefits from a consistent synth-keyboard style, upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads.","During my MTV days , Steve Winwood 's big 80 's splash with songs from Back In The High Life did not go unnoticed by me . and Chronicles , I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver , My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat "" While You See A Chance .

A34Y1FT0MTD7C9,B00138JAD6,1,1,4,"Slow Train Coming-Bob Dylan ****

Who saw it coming certainly not me. Bob Dylan a born and raised Jewish man who his entire career had songs dealing with his faith suddenly converted to Christianity. In 1978 Bob Dylan officialy converted to the Christian faith and has been devout ever since. In the process of embracing Jesus Christ as his lord and saviour he managed to write an entire album about it and a hit one at that. Slow Train coming would be the last hit Bob Dylan album for almost thirty years and it would also give him his last hit single of his career. Who knew that singing about the most contraversial subject ever could be turned into a massive success, only Dylan could make it happen.

After Slow Train Coming Dylan would go into a finger pointing faze preeching instead of spreading the word of his lord, but doing so with the threat of hellfire and brimstone and consequently losing a lot of his fan base in the process not that he cared. Slow Train Coming was a rare album and a rare moment in the history of Bob Dylan because we never saw him this happy, voulnerable, or inspired again in his career

With the exception of 'When You Gonna Wake Up' the album is mostly happy and up beat in praise and very possitive. The song 'When You Gonna Wake Up' was a sign of things to come in a negative way, becaus earound the corner was nothing but judgement from Dylan. Really it was nothing but albums of judgement. But being as this record was recorded with legendary hardcore Jewish producer Jerry Wexler (Ray Charles, Motown), I don't think the man would have stood for finger pointing. 'Gotta Serve Somebody' became Dylans last hit single of the 1970's as well as his last hit single of his career. It's got a very loose feel and is full of Jamacan influence and lots of heavy organ, it is easy to see why this became such a big hit. Throughout the album someone other then Bob Dylans musical abilities shine, and that is of Mark Knopfler of Dire Straights, yes the legandary axe slinger plays through out the album and is an asset to the team on tracks like 'Precious Angel' and 'Slow Train.' The former is amazing and would have fit well on Dire Straights debut. The later 'Slow Train' is quite simply one of the best songs that Bob Dylan has ever recorded in his life period.

Dylans lyrics have always been known for beig nothing short of brilliant, but on this album they seem and feel more inspired then usuall. That may be do to his new found faith. The imagery dipicted in his words are amazing and you feel like your there whitnessing Dylan speak to his lord right in front of you. 'Man Gave Names To All The Animals' does seem like nothing more then a childhood neursery rhyme but it does at nice texture to the album and lighten the mood a little as it is a nod to Noah and his ark.

Slow Train Coming is a must have for all fans of Dlyans work. It is his last essentail album for almost thirty years. After this Dylans albums were all hit or miss and even the decent ones are not essential and sound very dated. It wasn't until the late 1990's that Dylan did anything worth while. Since then he has released three albums that are among his best, Time Out Of Mind, Love And Theft, and Modern Times. Make Slow Train Coming apart of your Dylan collection.","Slow Train Coming - Bob Dylan * * * * Who saw it coming certainly not me . who his entire career had songs dealing with his faith suddenly converted to Christianity .

It's basically just I-make-more-money-and-do-more-ladies-than-you-so-I'm-cool gangsta club rap. The reason I give this 4.5 stars is that ALL 19 songs are great club tracks (that is indeed a bargain and contributes greatly to its mass appeal)! A must-have album for clubs and parties, but it doesn't really hold any other significant longterm value. Highly recommended for clubheads.

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000V672Y0,1,1,5,"During the mid to late 70's Robert Palmer was far from the household name he became during the mid 80's. At the same time at this point in the 70's one of the more fasionable things for a lot of white rock musicians was to record in the Crescent City with many of the local musicians from Dr. John,Allen Toussaint,Little Feat and The Meters. None of these projects were bad at all but strangly enough many of them were one or two off genre excersises that the said artist(s) never again returned to. This was not one of those efforts. Throughout even the 80's the core of Robert Palmers music was always soul and funk so it was only fitting he would make his first solo album in New Orleans with of course all the best people in town on board. Two of the most remarkable things about this are related to Palmer himself. He wrote or co-wrote almost all the music on this album and had a very keen understanding of how to create great funk music,from the honeyed nuances (as opposed to loud bellowing) of his vocal style. Now he does a great job for sure in interpreting Big Easy styled funk here from the rolling clavinets on Allen Toussaint's title track and ""From A Whisper To A Scream"" which Palmer also delivers with his great soulful understatement. There's more of an obvious Mardi Gras-style hump to the grooves of Lowell George's ""Sailin' Shoes"" and ""Blackmail"" but some of the most impressive songs on the album are the ones Palmer wrote himself. ""Hey Julia"" is an excellent song-a great rhythm box percussion led have jive/funk sort of groove with a really deep Carribean rhythm under the service;not so obvious it's emmediately detectable but it's there if you recognize it. ""Get Close"" and ""How Much Fun"" both illustrate an understanding of the elegance of funk and elegance is a quality that Palmer himself always possessed very strong. Of course for a SERIOUS represenation of that there's the twelve minute closer ""Through It All There's You"" where Palmer really works a hardcore jam to death with his wonderfully jazzily phrased licks and how the song builds up and down from a full band sound back to it's lower key tones from the beginning. It was only fitting that his 70's sound was built very strongly on the type of music presented on this album and it's a credit to his integrity that maintained a strong connection to this particular element of his sound throughout his career as opposed to totally disgarding them when they were no longer trendy in mass culture.","At the same time at this point in the 70 's one of the more fasionable things for a lot of white rock musicians was to record in the Crescent City with many of the local musicians from Dr. John , Allen Toussaint , Little Feat None of these projects were bad at all but strangly enough many of them were one and funk so it was only fitting he would make his first solo album in New Orleans with of course all the best people in town on board .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00IGNY09A,1,1,4,"There is no question that today's music has mostly been a poor set of singers that can't hold a tune where instead they can drive a hole into your heart. But for some legends, they can make great music last beyond a lifetime. Billy Joel is one of those artists. While it has been more than 20 years since he released his last pop album, River Of Dreams, his songs still stand beyond the test of time. He had so much going for him back in the 80's. He became a father when his daughter Alexa Ray was born, and he tied the knot the second time with Christie Brinkley. But he also had so many great concerts he had performed in the world. Billy had performed in Yankee Stadium as the first major pop act to perform at the house that Ruth built, and he became one of the most profiled artists to have ever graced the stage in the former Soviet Union. But nevertheless, Billy delivered with a eye-opening experience that set the world on fire.

Originally released as Kohuept in the late 80's, A Matter Of Trust: The Bridge To Russia is a great importance and brilliant concert into what made Billy Joel a distinctive legend. While he was on tour to support his record The Bridge, he made a set of concert in the former Soviet Union to perform in front of Soviet audiences that stood the test of time, and inspired one of Joel's most distinctive songs later on Lenningrad. The concert still shows why the Piano Man has been so classic after all this time. While Billy Joel wasn't the first U.S. performer to play the Superpower, that belonged to John Denver, but Billy was the most important to deliver. The songs still sound great and remain as important and classic as they were when they were released over 25 years ago. Songs like Piano Man, Uptown Girl and Allentown are very well remastered here, as well as songs that still stand, but haven't been released before like a rehearsal cut of New York State Of Mind, and songs like Allentown and She's Always A Woman which haven't released before on a live album. The songs sound great, and a great trip back in time to when music really had a thumbprint of changing the world, something today's artists really haven't even scratched the surface on.

There are some artists who have made some great live albums in the 80's. Elton John had Live In Australia with The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, and Billy Joel's A Matter Of Trust: The Bridge To Russia is one of those great records. If you have never, ever had heard the classic Piano Man's classic songs before, than you should get a good listen to this album. If you have bought Kohuept when it came out in the 80's, you'll absolutely love A Matter Of Trust: The Bridge To Russia. Billy Joel has always been a fantastic entertainer, and this is a blueprint of what made him so classic for all this time.

Exhale (Shoop Shoop,) is a sweet and simple song that ignites well in simplicity and soulfulness. It because the first song from a movie to debut at #1 on Billboard in 1995, and it still shows a lot of soul and simplicity. I have always liked the song because it really is better than most of the jokes on radio today. While Whitney somberly passed away a year ago, her songs still carry a tune beautifully. If you are discovering Whitney Houston for the first time, this is one song I definitely recommend for your music library.

If you are discovering Whitney Houston for the first time , this is one song I definitely recommend for your music library ."

A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B00142MQ0K,1,1,5,"Upon its release in 1981, this band's debut (and with this line-up, only) album quickly found itself dwarfed by the iconic track, ""Tell That Girl to Shut Up."" A decade later, when the song was turned into a hit by Transvision Vamp, the album from which it originally sprung (and the band that originally sprang it) receded yet another step from public renown. Things weren't helped by Virgin's reluctance to reissue the album on CD, nor the time-limited nature of this Wounded Bird's release. The hard-luck story leaves this great power-pop album once again difficult to find.

And rest assured, this is no one-hit wonder of an LP; Holly Beth Vincent's other songs were in the same league as ""Tell That Girl,"" and veteran producer Richard Gottehrer (Blondie, Go-Gos, Richard Hell & The Voidoids) deftly mated the verve of new wave and punk with the timeless sound of guitar-driven rock 'n' roll. Vincent's music is in a league with The Waitresses, Go-Go's and Pearl Harbor & The Explosions, but without the New Wave affectations that prematurely aged the competition's work. Think of this as a sharper-edged version of Bonnie Hayes & The Wild Combo's ""Good Clean Fun.""

Wounded Bird's reissue includes the original front and back covers and song lyrics for the album's original ten tracks. Four bonus cuts include the single edit of ""Miles Away"" and its B-side ""It's Only Me,"" along with two additional B-sides, the acidic ""Fanzine"" and the Ronnie Spector-styled ""Poster Boy."" MIA from this disc are the pre-LP 7"" version of ""Tell That Girl to Shut Up"" and its B-side ""Chapel of Love,"" which were disappointingly include on the CD reissued of Holly Beth Vincent's confusingly-titled follow-up solo LP, ""Holly and the Italians.""

This is worth searching for on the secondary market, as it's one of the best power-pop-punk albums to come out in the early '80s. [2006 hyperbolium dot com]","yet another step from public renown .

AJUNJ4JWSULI0,B000WL7MXU,-1,1,4,"I bought this set back last September when it was 50 Originals instead of Greatest (43) Originals. Ironically, back then I wrote ""It's a darned shame that at least a one unmarked re-recording snuck into this set. Runaway is obviously not the original version. (That's the only one I'm sure about; perhaps other reviewers can find more.) At least half of these songs really are the originals, and the collection would be easily worth the money just for them. I would have given ""45 Real Originals"" a 5-star review, but the sour taste of a re-recording lowers my rating for ""50 (Mostly) Originals"" to 4 stars.""

Now we've dropped below 45 songs, but that re-recording of Runaway is still one of them. This package is still a great value, but for sneaking in this clunker, I can only give it 4 stars.

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B004VSST9Q,1,1,5,"When Glee originally started, I have to admit that I expected a lot more vocalistic music than what ultimately began appearing on the soundtrack CD's. While I have found each of the discs to be enjoyable, they've often had their share of Karaoke Plus type of moments, and rarely outdid the original versions of the songs they started off covering. ""Glee Presents The Warblers"" changes that.

For starters, they enlist an actual Glee Club (the Tufts' University Beelzebubs) to perform the bulk of the vocal work. Then they give the lead focus to Darren Criss (Blaine on the show), one lead to Chris Colfer (Kurt) and a pair of duets for the two. It centers the album more than the other soundtracks, essentially making this Criss' debut album. Criss has a pleasant, boy-band type of voice, while Colfer sounds like the show-tunes worshiping kid he plays on the show when it's time for him to hit The Beatles' ""Blackbird."" (He's good on the Lennon-McCartney numbers; Colfer's version of ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" remains a series standout).

The selection is a solid representation of any typical ""Now That's What I Call Music"" CD, with current pop holding court. I was already partial to The Warblers' version of Katy Perry's ""Teenage Dream,"" then they chart similar courses on Beyonce's ""Bills Bills Bills"" and Maroon 5's ""Misery."" They redeem the long reviled McCartney ""Silly Love Songs"" and manage to make Barbra Streisand's ""What Kind Of Fool"" into the kind of song the Bee Gees might have done if Barry Gibb had kept the song for himself. (However, I doubt anyone will every be able to sing ""Do You Think I'm Sexy"" and make it anything better than a piffle.)

The constancy of ""Glee Presents The Warblers"" make it the best of The Glee series. It also may be the first starmaker of the series, propelling Darren Criss into a promising solo career. Now where's Colfer's solo?","When Glee originally started , I have to admit While I have found each of the discs to be enjoyable , they have often had their share of Karaoke Plus type of moments , and rarely outdid the original versions of the songs they started off covering .

AC0Z6U9OWFRT0,B00158SHD8,1,1,4,"Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, infamous for long delays between albums, sure has been productive lately. 2007 saw Reznor release the critically acclaimed ""Year Zero"" and its' follow-up ""Year Zero Remixed."" In addition, last year Reznor produced Saul Williams' ""The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust."" Now, out of nowhere, with no advance notice, Reznor is back with NIN's sixth album, the instrumental ""Ghosts I-IV.""

""A soundtrack for daydreams,"" is how Reznor sums up the new album...and that, I feel, is the best way to appreciate the new NIN. Rather than listening to this album as background music while driving or doing housework, ""Ghosts I-IV"" is best appreciated with relaxed, yet concentrated listening. Lie in bed or on the sofa, relaxed, and immerse yourself with this CD. Just sort of daydream--meditate, think about whatever...and let ""Ghosts I-IV"" be the soundtrack...

And as the mood of the album changes, allow your mood to flow with the album...try to get lost in the music.

Some have commented that ""Ghosts I-IV"" sounds similar in style to the instrumental music from ""The Fragile,"" (1999) but I don't know if it's all that accurate to say that. While the instrumental music from ""the Fragile"" sort of held the vocal compositions from that CD together like glue, ""Ghosts I-IV"" is a little more ""out there."" It can, therefore, be seen as a mosaic--of several different styles--piano compositions, industrial beats, the avant-garde--all mixed together, with no real dominant flavor overpowering the rest. And while the album is all-over-the-place, treading many territories, everything works; ""Ghosts I-IV"" takes so many twists-and-turns-its always interesting. At the same time, with almost two hours of music to absorb, ""Ghosts I-IV"" is best appreciated with repeated listens--to fully appreciate all its' rich textures and intricacy.","Nine Inch Nails ' Trent Reznor , infamous for long delays between albums , sure has been productive lately . 2007 saw Reznor release the critically acclaimed "" Year Zero "" In addition , last year Reznor produced Saul Williams ' "" The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust .

Yes there are too may effects, as Cher's vocals hardly need them, but in the disco halls it will be perfect.

The songs that scream perfection are The Song for the lonely, as well as Alive again,Love is a lonely place without you.. Cher is really expressive and gets these anthemic songs to where no other woman singer could.

After his wildly successful debut single, 1962's ""Sheila"", Tommy Roe went on to make 21 more appearances on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart over the next decade. A strong argument can be made that his 1966 Top Ten smash ""Sweet Pea"" was really the very first ""bubblegum"" hit. Recall that the term ""bubblegum"" did not appear until the heyday of Buddah records in 1968-1969 with groups like Ohio Express and the 1910 Fruitgum Co. At least one reviewer has complained that this is NOT the original recording.  I think he is correct but it really does not vary all that much from the original.  More likely than not this was an alternate take from the same recording session.","After his wildly successful debut single , 1962 's "" Sheila "" , Tommy Roe went on to make 21 more appearances on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart over the next decade .

AKGF27HN0OF19,B00122PK9Q,1,-1,3,"This one has to be Alice's most inconsistent albums.  It's material ranges all over the place seemingly in search of a direction, but not really finding one.  Cooper appears on the back cover with slicked back short hair, long sleeved dress shirt and a tie.  A complete 360 from his para military character from his last incarnation on ""Special Forces"".  This is another short one only being around 30 minutes long.  Album sales were close to rock bottom by this time with the album not even charting.  I did hear ""I Like Girls"" on my local AOR station a few times, but that was about it.  Although it gets panned by a lot of Cooper heads, I like a lot of this disc.  You get the feeling that Cooper is just having fun with a lot of this stuff, as much of the album is very light hearted and humorous.  Highlights include ""Zorro's Ascent"" a song about Alice Cooper as Zorro.  How he thought up this one I'll never know, but it is funny and cleaver.  Three songs in the middle all run together ""Adaptable"", ""I Like Girls"", and ""Remarkably Insincere"".  They are all short punchy rock songs with funny lyrics.  ""Tag You're It"" sees Alice as a horror movie director.......or is he really a killer?  This is a great song and harkens back to his ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" days.  ""It Better Be Good"" is another short fun rocker. On the other side of the coin there is some pretty dreadful stuff on this album as well.  ""I Am The Future"" sounds like it is from the cheesy movie soundtrack where it originated.  ""No Baloney Homosapiens"" is, well just look at the title and you can pretty much guess.  ""I'm Alive"" is another clunker that closes out the album.  Alice did not even tour around this album and it came and went pretty quickly.  Still, I like most of it and it is defiantly one of Cooper's most ""fun"" albums.","This one has to be Alice 's most inconsistent albums .

The rendition of Stevie Wonder's Songs In The Key Of Life staple As, featured in The Best Man Holiday soundtrack doesn't actually deliver. What Anthony Hamilton and Marsha Ambrousius of Floetry fame, doesn't actually deliver in the cover. It tries and be seductive as a slow jam, but it doesn't actually work in any way at all. In fact, the song feels more weak, and others who've covered the song did more justice to it. Like George Michael and Mary J. Blige who did the song over 15 years ago still delivers higher in sound and strength. It is definitely one of the worst Stevie Wonder covers' out there.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B01ETY725I,1,1,4,"This past year we have already lost a lot of legends in music whom have died before their time and fell to the waste side before our eyes, from Prince to David Bowie and Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire. This year has honestly been a tragic year for legends. But some of them have had so much to celebrate over the years, like this year for Phil Collins, whom had stepped away from the music industry for quite awhile to take care of some health problems. Well, now he is making a return to the industry, and celebrating his music all over. But anyway, he also celebrated some huge milestones this year, celebrating the 35th anniversary of his solo debut Face Value, and the 30th anniversary of him winning Album Of The Year at The Grammy awards for his No Jacket Required album. But when he was going to re-release all of his studio albums again, he had a lot of albums being celebrated, but was taking a step back on one album, and changing it to a different record.

The Essential Going Back, is more like a recreation of his 2010 album Going Back, where Phil Collins recorded a lot of classic standards and covers of songs he had grown up listening to, and celebrated the music of soul in the 60's and 50's. But fort this re-release of the original 2010 Going Back album, which had two versions, Phil decided instead to reduce the tracks being re-released instead of releasing all the tracks from both of his 2010 versions. Still, you do get some really good tracks being remastered like (Love Is Like A) Heatwave, his rendition of Stevie Wonder's Uptight, his soulful rendition of Some Of Your Lovin' and a driven rendition of The Temptations standard Papa Was A Rolling Stone. There also are some live songs which were never released as original recordings on the studio album a soulful cover of The Temptations hit My Girl and Too Many Fish In The Sea. Yet, the downside to this release for die hard Phil Collins fans whom have bought the earlier versions of Going Back released in 2010 is that there were a lot of good songs that were cut out of the re-release like In My Lonely Room, a soulful cover of Standing In The Shadows Of Love and Jimmy Mack to name a few songs.

Still, despite a few songs being overlooked, which Phil Collins intentionally said he would do, because he felt the deluxe version and even the original version would be a little too much of a hassle being re-released as a album, The Essential Going Back is a good buy for mainly the die hard Phil Collins fans where the live tracks are worth the while, but for newcomers to Phil Collins music, they might want to take the step back and listen to the original album versions, regular and deluxe from 2010 to get a better ear of what Phil had made musically from his soul first, before they sink their teeth into The Essential Going Back. Still, it is a good buy for hard core Phil Collins fans that is nobly worth the dollar.

Even though I am not of Christian faith, I can truly appreciate Dylan's soul searching lyrics.  I Believe In You, Serve Somebody, When You Gonna Wake Up, and most of the others are quite touching especially with Dylan's delivery.  As a matter Dylans vocal performance is near the best of his career.

Slow Train Comming stands strong as compared to Saved in its diverse musical arrangements.  Some songs are fast paced and others slow.  Some are more keyboard driven and others feature Mark Knophler's fine guitar playing.

Overall this is recording is a True winner.","Slow Train Comming is one of Bob Dylan 's 3 Christian / Gospel era recordings .

A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B0012483KW,1,1,5,"Back in 1968, when I was 17 years old, most of my contemporaries were into music by people like Jimi Hendrix, Cream and the Rolling Stones. While I enjoyed all kinds of music, my preference during that time was for much tamer music. In the summer of that year, The Vogues released ""Turn Around, Look At Me"" a remake of a relatively obscure Glen Campbell tune from several years earlier. I immediately fell in love with the song and the group. The Vogues had been around for awhile, having achieved significant chart success on Pittsburgh's Co&Ce label with songs like ""You're The One"", ""Five O'Clock World"" and ""The Land of Milk and Honey"". But this sound was different. Fifties rocker Ernie Freeman had become the producer/arranger for the group. His combination of lush production values and impeccable harmonies produced an incredibly pleasing sound that proved wildly successful. ""Turn Around"" was a huge hit for the group and was followed in swift succession by remakes of ""My Special Angel"", ""Earth Angel"", ""Till"", ""Moments to Remember"", ""Green Fields"" and others. I bought every one of these singles. In fact, I enjoyed The Vogues so much that I used to even play the flip sides frequently.  Here's to one of the best records they ever made.","when I was 17 years old , most of my contemporaries were into music by people like Jimi Hendrix , Cream While I enjoyed all kinds of music , my preference during that year , The Vogues released "" Turn Around , Look At Me "" a remake of a relatively obscure Glen Campbell tune from several years earlier .

A167XT46396JZ4,B005VZMNYA,1,1,5,"These collections are often mixes of the same pieces that have been presented in other low price collections of music on the BIS label. I don't have a lot of these but know that those who do often complain about the duplication. My view on this is that if there are enough new tracks then the packages are usually worth buying.
In the case of this Handel release there are some gems that are worth the price of this collection alone. The performance of Handel's Messiah by Masaaki Suzuki and the Bach Collegium of Japan (using authentic instruments)is one example. The tracks included here do not include the opening ""And Without Controversy"" reading from (I Timothy 3 : 16)which often precedes the music in performance,but not always on recordings. It is on the original Suzuki recording though, but I imagine only purists would complain about its absence here when otherwise this is a fine complete performance with both English and Japanese forces (leading at times  to some quaint stresses from the choir) that has been reviewed well elsewhere. Although not the top recommendation it does stand up well, and at this price is certainly worth a place in your collection.

Other favourites in this collection are the Concerti Grosso played by Arte de Suonatori under Martin Gester, a Polish Baroque Orchestra, who give fine performances of four of these Concerti fronm their well-received collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Handel-G-Concerto-Grossi-Op-6-Arte-Dei-Suonatori/dp/B002WP1JS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Handel, G.: Concerto Grossi, Op. 6 (Arte Dei Suonatori)</a>. These are stylishly played in an authentic manner with authentic instruments.

Another ""authentic"" group are the London Baroque who, apart from a lovely G minor Trio Sonata are joined by top English baroque soprano Dame Emma Kirkby in Handel's short Salve Regina in G minor from the CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emma-Kirkby-Handel-Sacred-Cantatas-London-Baroque/dp/B00005K2AX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emma Kirkby - Handel: Sacred Cantatas / London Baroque</a>&nbsp;but not, it seems, otherwise available as a download. These are superb performances, thoroughly enjoyable and in good recordings. She is such an expressive sensitive singer (hear her Dido in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Purcell-Dido-And-Aeneas/dp/B003X7MI0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Purcell: Dido And Aeneas</a>&nbsp;and (my favourite)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Purcell-Dido-And-Aeneas/dp/B00119ZA6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Purcell: Dido And Aeneas</a>.

A second Trio Sonata, (C minor HWV 386a)is offered by Italian Baroque group I Quattro Temperamenti, a sample from their BIS album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Handel-9-German-Arias-Hwv-202-210-Trio-Sonata-In-C-Minor-Hwv-386a/dp/B002PQTIVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Handel: 9 German Arias, Hwv 202-210 / Trio Sonata In C Minor, Hwv 386a</a>. This is sweetly and stylishly played: harpsichord, cello, violin and recorder.

We are treated to an Organ Concerto and an Oboe Concerto as well as a couple extracts from pieces - a single oboe concerto movement played with a very full tone by Jiri Krecji(couldn't we have had the whole concerto?), and a single movement from a keyboard piece suite, this one a sarabande based on the ""La Folia"" motif played on piano by Alisa Bratslavskaya. We hear the full G Minor Oboe concerto payed by Krecji and the Slovak Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Bohdan Warchal in a muscular performance that has character and beauty. I like the oboe tone, rich and clear with great fluidity of style in the faster passages.

The Organ Concerto (No. 10, Op 7) is played by Harald Feller and the Capella Istrapolitana with Paul Kantschieder, a band well known for some excellent baroque performances on Naxos. This is sensitively played. The opening meditative adagio is an unusual start to a concerto and gets us into a receptive mood for the following movements which then rise to greet the heavens in with some majestic, but not heavy, playing from Herr Feller, a German organist well known for his performances of the German repertoire.

A few Handel favourites are represented here by the ""Arrival of the Queen of Sheba"", The Largo from Xerxes, ""Lascia Ch'io pianga"" from Rinaldo as well as the 3 Suites from the ""Water Music"" and ""The Music for the Royal Fireworks"". These latter are well known in various performances, from the grand style to the more recent ""authentic"" styles. Great music like this can cope with being played differently (just check out the different Messiahs), and it is more often a question of taste rather than which is ""best"" in choosing recordings. What collections like this enable us to do is to  hear different perfomances that we may not have chosen but which can still offer new and enlightening interpretations.

The ""Water Music"" Suites and the ""Fireworks"" music are played here by the St Petersburg Radio Symphony Orchestra under Stanislav Gorkovenko. From the start I knew I was going to like his Water Music. The the water is deep and has a steady flow, the overture taking us into a collection of movements that are varied and well played. They don't have the sparkle of a Marriner but there is sense of cohesion in the balance of the instruments that may not have been there on a boat on the Thames but suits a recording well. Whilst this is outdoor music it doesn't have to rise above the sounds of boats and waves in our living rooms! Sometimes the performances may seem a bit understated but overall they are enjoyable.
The Fireworks Music for me has to compete with Sir Charles Mackerras' performance from the 1960s recorded in the middle of the night with all available players from the London orchestras<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Music-for-the-Royal-Fireworks-Cti-a-Due-Cori/dp/B00006L3X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Music for the Royal Fireworks / Cti a Due Cori</a>. This, of course is the original version for Wind Orchestra for outdoors performance with  fireworks. Here we have the orchestral version with strings which doesn't have the same wall of wind effect of Mackerras' recording. I found the recording and performance more understated than I would like - but well played with verve and style.

Handel's Largo always goes down well and this performance by Yoshikazu Mela with the Japan Philharmonic comes across as a pleasant addition to this collection - Mela is a countertenor with a pure voice that rises above the orchestra with a rare beauty. He is also represented in the Messiah presented here so we are treated to a real talent. Countertenors vary in their tone, some are True countertenors - men with a True vocal range, others rely on a Falsetto style to take their, often tenor, voices into the upper registers - never quite as satisfactory in my opinion. None these days are ""castrati"", for whom some of their repertoire were composed.

All in all, then, an excellent collection of music played with a mix of authentic and modern instrument bands. At the current price you can't go wrong with this.","that have been presented in other low price collections of music on the BIS label . who do often complain about the duplication . that if there are enough new tracks then the packages are usually worth buying .

Regardless of deeper meanings this song just resonates with me.  The bouncy feel and beat just never get old and Jewel's voice is extraordinary. It's hard to believe it's over 20 years old. It still seems fresh and relevant.

Jewel nails it with her first song. No just that it stands the test of time very well.

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B0012ELM8W,1,1,4,"In the 70's, groups like Bread, Seals & Crofts and England Dan & John Ford Coley made immaculate light pop, and this is a near perfect selection of their main hits. There was a touch of folk to their songs (with both men meeting in Texas, not too far off) and they made one of the best Todd Rundgren covers ever (""Love Is The Answer""). The other four songs are beautifully harmonized top tens from the late 70's, and to this day ""Nights Are Forever"" and ""I'd Really Love To See You Tonight"" hold a certain simple innocence.

I read today that Dan Seals has passed. These songs and his eventual starring turn as a country artist show how much talent the man had and how underrated his work has been.","In the 70 's , groups like Bread , Seals & Crofts and England Dan & John Ford Coley made immaculate light pop , and this is a near perfect selection of their main hits . and they made one of the best Todd Rundgren covers ever ( "" Love Is The Answer "" ) .

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00970FKQ8,1,1,4,"By all accounts, I should not like this song.  I don't know a word of Korean, so most of the lyrics went straight over my head.  I don't listen to Asian pop much, so the style is one I'm unfamiliar with.  And the fact that Psy doesn't actually sing for most of the song, instead mainly talking over the music, should have turned me off.  I should have dismissed the song as a passing fad and gone on with my life.

But I made the mistake of listening to the song on YouTube... and it lodged itself in my brain.  And I ended up liking it well enough to purchase a copy.  It's no musical masterpiece, but dang is it catchy and fun.

For those more used to American-style music, ""Gangnam Style"" is something of a departure from it.  It's heavy on the synthesizer, much like a lot of the hits of the '80s, and has a fast, almost frantic beat to it.  As stated before, Psy talks his way through most of the song, only singing at the chorus (he does do a decent job of singing, though, so it's not for lack of talent).  This gives the song almost something of a rap feel, though it sounds quite different from traditional rap.  And of course, it's an upbeat number that almost encourages the listener to get up and dance -- I find it almost physically impossible to hold still while listening to this song.

And no, I don't understand any of the lyrics aside from the titular ""Gangnam style"" (said to refer to a city) and the occasional belting out of ""Hey, sexy lady!""  No, I don't know if it fits in the context of the song or not... XD

Call me a sell-out, but I rather enjoyed this song.  It's a fun and upbeat dance number, even if you don't know how to do the signature dance that goes with it.  Good as an introductory number to K-Pop, and a fun party number.","By all accounts , I should not like this song . I do not know a word of Korean , so most of the lyrics went straight over my head .

A8SCX6VUTE05H,B001ESDIQ0,-1,-1,3,"Lil Wayne has always had a problem of proving himself as ""best rapper alive"". Sure he can bust a dope freestyle now and then but he has never made a classic album. Lights Out, The Carter and Carter II were good but they were far from classics. If you are going to call yourself the greatest the least you can do is make a great album. The Carter II was great lyrically(for the most part) but the production was suspect. The production on this album is better than the production on Carter II but lyrically its not better than Carter II. There are some good songs to be found on here: A Milli feat Corey Gunz is a banger. 3Peat, Let The Beat Build, Tie My Hands(feat Robin Thicke) are passable. Mr Carter feat Jay-z is pretty good and Dr Carter is probably the most creative track that Wayne has ever made. Comfortable feat Babyface(which samples the ending of Alicia Keys' You Dont Know My Name) is a good track for the ladies. Despite these tracks, the album is weaighed down heavily with garbage tracks. P**** Monster, Phone Home(nice beat but WTF???) and the deadly dull Shoot Me Down are prime examples of what I'm talking about. The ringtone classic Lollipop(feat Static Major RIP) should have been slammed in the trash. Fabolous FLOORS Lil Wayne and Juelz Santana on You Aint Got Nothin. Mrs Officer is a waste of Bobby Valentino's talent and our time and probably has the dumbest chorus on the album(weeoooweeweeoooweeeoooweee?). La La feat Busta Rhymes and Brisco sucks point blank period.  Got Money feat T-Pain is a failed club banger and Dontgetit is ruined by Wayne speaking his mind on why he hates Al Sharpton. Now we all know that Al Sharpton is a person of questionable character(unless you're sheep) but Wayne isn't bright enough to defend his position so he ends up sounding stupid as hell. At any rate if this was the album that was supposed to prove that he was the greatest then that remains to be seen. The production for the most part is not bad but sometimes Wayne's rhymes were either mediocre and sometimes he sounded like he didn't even finish his punchlines. Wayne should get rid of the ego and just concentrate on making a quality album because this one is far from his True potential.","Lil Wayne has always had a problem of proving himself as "" best rapper alive "" .

A2WETFLJM0D6R0,B00138JAD6,1,1,4,"Dylan's career epitomizes change. He has buffeted and tossed fans around on a wild sea of change and reinvention since 1965 (when he picked up an electric guitar in defiance of the folk community's unwritten rules). The year 1979 saw his most shocking transition. One that challenged and threatened Dylan's career like no other. Dylan began espousing Christianity and throwing around the term ""born again"". Jerry Wexler, who produced ""Slow Train Coming"", told Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin that ""I had no idea he was on this born-again Christian trip until he started to evangelize me."" Wexler diplomatically told Dylan to back off, but he produced the album anyway. So in the heyday of punk the performer many people associated, fairly or unfairly, with 1960s ""radicalism"" turned explicitly Christian. Not only that, 1978's ""Street Legal"" met with an extremely icy reception. For many fans Dylan's new ""phase"" was too much.

Dylan's ""Christian phase"" (though arguably not a phase) now looks somewhat innocuous from a historical perspective. After two (some say one, some say three) more ""Christian"" albums, Dylan's lyrics morphed once again. Would his career have survived had he plunged permanently into Christian music? Hard to say. Many thought he was through in 1965. He may have simply found a different audience (though in the 1970s that audience would probably have been a small one). Regardless, the 1980s were probably the low point of Dylan's career from many perspectives.

""Slow Train Coming"" is a Christian album. It makes no apologies for this. Though far less preachy than its successor, ""Saved"", the theme of the album remains unmistakable. ""When He Returns"", the album's passionate closer, more than demonstrates this with lines such as ""He's got plans of his own to set up His throne when He returns"".

Whether or not listeners accept this album most likely depends on their attitude towards the lyrics. Because there's nothing wrong with the music on ""Slow Train Coming"". ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" grooves in a way that Dylan had never really grooved previously. ""Precious Angel"" features Mark Knoplfer's distinctive guitar style and probably one of the best Dylan drawls ever recorded: ""Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself. I'm a little too blind to seeeEEEeeeeee."" ""Slow Train"" contains an ominous groove. ""When you Gonna Wake Up"" lashes out at society's failings. Whether one agrees with the religious perspective or not, the criticism here seems valid and constructive. Only ""Man Gave Names To All The Animals"" sounds a little trite. Everything else on ""Slow Train Coming"" receives passion and conviction. Again, whether or not one agrees with the overall message, Dylan's performance is outstanding on this album (it even bagged him a Grammy for ""Best Rock Vocal"" - something his detractors, especially those who find his distinctive voice grating, must have cringed at).

""Slow Train Coming"" just adds proof to the argument that Bob Dylan remains one of the most provocative, controversial, and intruiguing artists of the 20th century. Apart from the music, he's given his fans plenty of challenges, and given future generations an almost insurmountable amount of material to ponder and debate about.","and tossed fans around on a wild sea of change when he picked up an electric guitar in defiance of the folk community 's unwritten rules ) .

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00OUVU2TO,1,1,4,"I recently saw the Decemberists in concert again (more on that later). It was my first time in almost a decade (8 years, to be exact) that I had seen them live, and during that span, they have grown into a widely popular band, both on the concert circuit as well as on the album charts.

""What A Terrible World, What A Beautiful World"" (14 tracks; 53 min.) starts off with the very subdued ""The Singer Addresses His Audience"", but things immediately pick up with ""Calvary Captain"", which reminds me of REM's ""Losing My Relogion"". In fact, it is amazing how many similarities, sound-wise, there are between the Decemberists and REM, and with REM having retired from the music scene, the Decemberists clearly have taken over that sweet spot where pop-folk-Americana convene. ""What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World"" finds the band relaxed yet very confident, and the resulting album is strong throughout. Other highlights for me include the pensive ""The Wrong Year"", the ironic ""Anti-Summersong"", and the album's closer ""A Beginning Song"".

I recently saw the Decemberists at the rapidly-growing Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati. The band was the next-to-last to play on the second main stage on a hot and humid Saturday evening, but the weather didn't stop them from bringing us a 60 min. set that bristled with energy. The career-spanning set of course was heavy on the new album, starting off with ""A Beginning Song"" (which makes a lot more sense than having it as the album's loser), then going to ""Calvary Captain"" before going ""Down By The Water"", and on and on. It was a brilliant set, period, and one of THE highlights of the festival for me. The MASSIVE crowd absolutely ate it up. If you have a chance to see the Decemberists in concert, do not miss them!

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B01BKYPCIY,1,-1,3,"The problem I have with Stefani's music is that it's like candy--sweet and sickly at the same time. Ultimately, her music leaves you with a sugar crash afterward. I have all three of her solo cds, plus all of No Doubt's cds. I didn't enjoy the last No Doubt cd either.

""This Is What The Truth Feels Like..."" is Stefani's first solo work in 10 years. This is probably the best of the three solo albums. It is certainly her most mature. Most of the irritating idiosyncrasies from her first two cds are scrubbed out here to good results. The only clunker here is ""Naughty"" which just comes off as so amateurish for a 46 year old woman.

There's much to like here, and there should be hit singles all around, but things have changed in the past 10 years, and Stefani also passed that popular music death mark--age 40. I notice that none of her past four singles released between 2014 and now have cracked the Top 40. This is a shame, because I'd rather listen to Stefani than Gomez, Lorde, Azalea, Lovato, Jepsen, and a whole host of other young ladies.

I give ""This Is What The Truth Feels Like..."" three and a half stars because it's good, but not quite four stars. There's always a sort of over-produced quality to Stefani's music that strips it of having real emotional impact and resonance. She can't create an album without at least eight different producers on it, which gives all of her albums an uneven quality to them.

""Misery"", ""You're My Favorite"", ""Make Me Like You"", ""Truth"", and ""Used To Love You"" are the best tracks here, and the most likely candidates for a Top 40 hit.

Bring on the next No Doubt album. Here's how ""This Is What The Truth Feels Like..."" compares to Stefani's other work:

Honestly, her daughter then son made more headlines than her the past several years, Chastity now Chaz, by becoming a man and then making his way as a part of Dancing With The Stars. Cher also coming pop retirement has decided to try and deliver in her own work again with singing. But honestly, her return hasn't been the big, "" Wow, I have got to have this moment that it!,"" it could've been. Her song Woman's World, from her 20123 album Closer To The Truth isn't a bad song, but honestly not as big as when she came back on top in the 90's with songs like Strong Enough and Believe. It is alright, but honestly not a strong song that dominates, but it still is classic Cher alone. If you are a die hard fan of Cher's than you'll download this song, but otherwise go back to songs like Song For The Lonely to make it more worth the effort.

A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000W20FY2,1,1,5,"During my MTV days, Steve Winwood's big 80's splash with songs from Back In The High Life didn't go unnoticed by me.  After discovering that album and Chronicles, I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver, which I copied.  My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat ""While You See A Chance.""  Winwood's sweeping organ-like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit-it reached #7 in 1981-along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio-friendly beat, with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing.  I find myself enjoying this song more than ""Higher Love.""

The title track reached #48 on the singles chart, a slower midpaced affair.  ""Spanish Dancer"" along the same languid lines, may be an example of what many called ""lazy music"" to describe Winwood's early solo stuff.  This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life.

I wonder why ""Second-Hand Woman"" wasn't a chart-topper, as it's a more lively affair with Winwood's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat.  Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being ""a slot machine to take my dime"" but it is quite the danceable track.  The same holds True for the near eight minute on-the-run opus ""Night Train"" with its funky beats mixed with guitars, particularly a solo around the six minute mark, and the usual keyboards.  A single mix of this could've done well, but alas.

Two non-singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs.  They are ""Slowdown Sundown.""  A wistful ballad, calling wine that ""glassful of memories""  and something to soothe the balm of yesterday's pain.  The tempo goes up during the bridge, which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life.  The closing track ""Dust"" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away, in this case meaning time with a woman, yet how to deal with a love that's gone, but a friendship that still remains?  Indeed, ""a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing,"" meaning time, ""the universal healer.""  That brings to mind the Dr. Who quote ""the sands of time wash us all clean.""

Mellow, but not ""lazy music"" as was described by some, Arc Of A Diver shows that Winwood still had some life in him following Traffic.  Considering the turn-of-the-decade changes going on in the music scene, i.e. punk and new wave, it's fortunate that Arc found an audience.  And Winwood played all the instruments on the album, much like Prince had done his own debut For You.  Despite having only seven songs, Arc benefits from a consistent synth-keyboard style, upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads.","During my MTV days , Steve Winwood 's big 80 's splash with songs from Back In The High Life did not go unnoticed by me . and Chronicles , I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver , My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat "" While You See A Chance .

Since their sophomore release this trio from Ireland has grown on me and with '#3', they have become a regular in my listening cycle. Their blend of harmonies and rap along with their one of a kind lyrical capabilities makes '#3'one of the most unique albums of 2012. As a person who was not the biggest fan of their debut, I am now tempted to give it another listen. No two songs on this album sound the same. The meaning of each song is different. Each one puts you in a different mood. Some are sing-a-longs and some are just great listens. One thing is for sure, The Script is now going to be one of those bands that will stand the test of time. While they may not be in the limelight on a constant basis, they will keep putting out records and remain a household name among the fan base. '#3' is a great album, and it is definitely worth a listen if anything.","While they may not be one of the best groups in music , they are surely one of the most original .

AF74UAKV3Q3W0,B00D02YNK8,1,1,5,"""Voyage - Hiroshima Eternal"" is the third release from artist/sculptor/architect/electronic musician/composer Takashi Suzuki. Born and currently residing in Hiroshima, Japan, Suzuki  designed a monument for Edmund Blunden's poem, ""A Song for August 6th, 1949,"" which won first place in a competition in 1975 and stands in the garden of The Hiroshima Central Library. The sculpture features the words to the poem in both English and Japanese and is still a stunning and moving tribute to the spirit and resilience of the city and its people following one of the darkest days of modern history. Despite the title, the music composed for this album is neither a memorial nor a protest against nuclear weapons. It is Suzuki's imaginary story of someone who died in the event and then journeys through the unknown spiritual world. The eight tracks and their titles are the imagined stages of the journey, ending with reincarnation and a new life.

It is interesting to note that Suzuki composes his music in a similar manner to creating his visual artwork, finishing one piece before moving to the next and allowing the previous work to influence the new work. This gives his music a linear quality and continuity that is its own evolution. Very minimal as well as ambient, the music has a dark, soulful quality that is sometimes mysterious or mournful and sometimes a bit lighter and more hopeful (but not joyous). The mood lightens gradually as the journey progresses and the spirit finds its way and discovers its purpose. Created with synths, the instrumentation includes ethereal and atmospheric sounds, strings, voices, bells, light percussion, and other sounds without any specific cultural reference. As with Suzuki's previous releases, the sound quality is full and rich. ""Resonance,"" his debut, received the 2011 Best Ambient Album award from Zone Music Reporter, and ""Cycle"" was nominated as the Best Relaxation/Meditation Album and Best Ambient Album for 2012 by the same organization. I would fully expect similar acclaim for ""Voyage,"" another extraordinary musical experience from this fascinating artist.","which won first place in a competition in 1975 and is still a stunning and moving tribute to the spirit and its people following one of the darkest days of modern history .

A1D22OU25XABAK,B00138J7EI,1,1,5,"The best of what redeemed the eighties from MTV crap. This was and still is a dense cacophony of beauty and your classic 80s angst and cynicism with moments of tentative redemption. Everyone's got their favorite 80s icons- they're probably mine because I got to see them in a small venue at the height of their powers, just after this had come out. Nothing burns into your teenage brain permanently like a great rock group when they're on top of their game, before they're just paying the bills and trying not to punch each other out in the process.

""She is Mine"" is a standout; Butler's seething rasp can have its oddly tender moments. (I still think he's one of the all-time sexiest vocalists- and I just die when he talk-sings ""Ha Ha Ha"". Classic Butler-ism.). While ""Pretty In Pink"" tends to give me the Mollyringwalds and it seems a bit sexist, I still love it for what it reminds me of: that great p-furs signature intro.

""Into you like a train"" is just full-speed searing beauty, guitars sweeping around you. And ""No Tears"" perfectly captures 80s wariness of political activism and the ensuing apathy /antagonism with the problematic radicals of the day (""There's demonstrations, and demonstrations.... you don't have a point of view. You don't have to say you do"".

While occasionally Butler has his Dylan-ish moments of lyrical nonsense, they do work in their 80s way, like a collage of imagery and emotional impressions, not literal straightforward meanings in lyrics.

It has a  melodic, yet driving, layered noise. I could never go full atonal - the No Wave thing, so this has that kind of energy, in a sense, yet is tight and has a sense of tune you can remember, as opposed to just tuneless screeching. The layers & textures never get in the way of the lyrical/melodic line- it always sounds like it's just short of all parts crashing together, yet it's sort of a controlled chaos that sweeps past you and around you. Also, this album has density without all the twinkly, trebly production that ""Forever Now"" has to make it more radio-friendly.

Plus this just brings out the adolescent clove-smoker in me, when all this stuff seemed so romantic! ""So run Down"" is another great track- reminds me of that teenage time when even a bad hangover seemed like a new adventure!

Between the Furs & the Bunnymen, it was all shades and trenchcoats here on out...and that wasn't such as a bad thing at a tender age.","The best of what redeemed the eighties from MTV crap . and still is a dense cacophony of beauty and your classic 80s angst and cynicism with moments of tentative redemption .

Though Southern rock has always been the default template of Third Day, there's always discernable threads of worship music in their prodigious portfolio of songs.  And over their storied career where they have had received 28 chart topping singles and sold over 7 million records, Third Day's best moments are arguably encapsulated in their worship songs.  This is why their former worship albums, namely 2000's ""Offerings"" and 2003's ""Offerings II,"" are often regarded by avid fans as their catalog treasures.  12 years after ""Offerings II,"" Third Day are back with their third and most satisfying worship album to date.  Unlike their former two worship records which are more or less a pastiche of live tracks, new songs, formerly released songs, and covers slapdash together, ""Lead Me Home"" is a seamless affair of entirely studio recorded tracks freshly penned just for this disc.

Hands down, the ""wow"" factor of ""Lead Us Back"" is squarely centered on lead singer Mac Powell's charismatic vocals.  Take a listen to their single ""Our Deliverer.""  With his bright booming voice that calls to mind Casting Crowns' Mark Hall, Powell brings an air of Godly confidence to ""Our Deliverer,"" an anthem of faith that awaits the second coming of Jesus Christ. Then hear Powell takes his vocals on a roller coaster ride with the hilly hymn-like ""He's Alive,"" a worship song that ought to make it into the repertoire of churches come Easter.  Powell who has had a couple of excursions in releasing his solo country albums certainly brings his rustic sound to bare on the folky ""Soul on Fire"" (co-written with Matt Maher) where All Sons and Daughters can be heard in the backing department.

But Third Day are not just interested in just making worship songs.  Songs like ""Spirit"" and ""Your Words"" have a sing-along quality reminiscent of many of Hillsongs' paeans that create invitations for congregation members to want to sing along.  This is particularly True of ""Spirit"" which has a choral backing tailored for church worship.  And the best amongst the congregational-focused song that is destined to be a classic is ""In Jesus' Name."" Not a cover of Darlene Zschech's song of the same titular, ""In Jesus' Name"" is a transcendent power ballad that features the voices of Christian music's top artists such as Michael W. Smith, David Crowder, Natalie Grant, and Michael Tait.

Fans who yearn for a softer moment without the tight blast of guitars and drums will take delight in the album's final track ""The One I Love."" This song simply is a testament of what a great vocalist Powell is.  Even with just his soaring vocals, a backing vocalist, and an acoustic guitar, he can still lead us into God's throne room with such grace and verve.  This track by itself speaks volumes of the passion Third Day puts into this record.  In sum, this truly is a well-invested album made specifically to lead us back to the woship of the King of kings.","Prime Cuts : Our Deliverer , In Jesus ' Name , The One I Love

""Beautiful"" is one of the most exquisite, uplifting and moving songs I've ever heard. Christina Aguilera handles this song by Linda Perry wonderfully; she sings the lyrics with genuine passion and that's grand.

The musical arrangement, especially with that cello, fits in perfectly with Christina's vocals.

The message of the song is that anyone struggling with a lack of self-esteem should remember that inner beauty counts for quite a lot and that other people's criticism and lack of respect for someone should be ignored as long as they're a good person on the inside.

I highly recommend this song. It's one of Christina Aguilera's best songs ever; just one listen proves it!","and sung here by Christina Aguilera

AV5G37VFE5NVD,B005MVLI8A,1,1,5,"nirvana (noun) - a place or state characterized by freedom from or oblivion to pain, worry, and the external world.

grunge (noun) - dirt, filth, rubbish; something of inferior quality; trash.

The 1980s were one big, immoral popularity contest.  Never mind the quality - if it was ""in,"" people wanted it.  While hard rock had dominated most of the 1970s, the 80s were all about pop: artists like Michael Jackson, Phil Collins, Lionel Ritchie, and Whitney Houston.  By 1980, punk rock, which began in the mid-70s, had evolved into ""new wave,"" spawning groups like Tears for Fears and A Flock of Seagulls.  Meanwhile, rock titans like Neil Young seemed to have lost all the edginess that made them so attractive; Bob Dylan stumbled through the decade, fashioning a couple great albums and releasing a much greater number of duds.  Music aficionados were forced to ponder the direst of ponderings: was rock dead?

Whether rock was dead or alive, Nirvana rejuvenated it and brought it back to the forefront, nearly stopping pop in its place.  The world hadn't heard anything so ferocious and reeling with pained awareness since the days of the Sex Pistols, and for a world still feeling hungover from the superficial craze of the 1980s, it was a welcome wake-up call.  Nirvana actually emerged at the end of the 80s, led by lead vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain and also featuring Krist Novoselic on bass and, initially, Chad Channing on the drums.  They released their debut, ""Bleach,"" in 1989, produced and recorded for a mere $600 on the Sub Pop label.  It sold roughly 6,000 copies.  When the band heard that Sub Pop was going to become a subsidiary for a major label, they decided to ""cut out the middleman"" and were signed to Geffen Records.  ""Grunge"" music, the murky indie-alternative rock played by groups like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, or, more famously, Pearl Jam, was on the verge of becoming popular.  Geffen executives hoped Nirvana could find some fame as one of the better grunge bands.  They hoped to sell 250,000 copies of Nirvana's second effort, 1991's ""Nevermind,"" earning a ""Gold"" certification from the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America).  The band themselves didn't really care.

When the record was released in late 1991, MTV's late night music video showcase ""120 Minutes"" began playing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" the album's lead single.  Soon it became so popular that the network began playing it during the day.  The album appeared on the Billboard 200 at #144, and in November of '91 it entered the Billboard Top 40 at #35.  Half of the initial U.S. pressings went to the northwest, where the album quickly sold out and was unavailable for days.  Around the rest of the country, the album began selling so quickly that none of Geffen's marketing strategies could be enacted.  Finally, in January of 1992, Nevermind hit #1 on the Billboard Top 40.  At that time, it was selling roughly 300,000 copies per week.

Critical response to the album was decidedly mixed.  Rolling Stone gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying, ""If Nirvana isn't onto anything altogether new, Nevermind does possess the songs, character and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radio's high-octane hits.""  On the other hand, Robert Christgau, the so-called ""Dean of American Rock Critics,"" gave the album an A.  ""This is hard rock as the term was understood before metal moved in - the kind of loud, slovenly, tuneful music you think no one will ever work a change on again until the next time it happens,"" Christgau wrote.

That's exactly what ""Nevermind"" is: a hard rock, post-punk album picking up where the punk groups of the 1970s left off.  It's harder now to understand just what an impact it had upon its release. Nirvana's sound has been imitated countless times by countless groups (Nickelback, Creed, etc. etc.), resulting in a new form of rock: grunge.  When Nevermind was released at the beginning of the 90s, despite its cover art depicting a baby pursuing a dollar bill on a fishing hook underwater, it was like a generation coming up for air after being drowned in commercial, spiritless noise for a decade.  Nirvana defined its generation like no other, and ""Nevermind"" was the crucial album of the 1990s.

To really understand the album or the band, one must be familiar with its leader: the legendary, quasi-infamous Kurt Cobain.  Most people are very familiar with him, due in no small part to his untimely and much-discussed death in 1994.  He was born in Aberdeen, Washington, a small coastal town that looks like something out of ""The Fog.""  Friends and family have said that he was the sweetest of children, but his teenage years were a horse of a different color. Cobain hated athletics (despite his father signing him up for the local wrestling and baseball teams, on which Cobain did quite well) and befriended a gay student, leading to taunts and bullying from Cobain's peers.  He focused mostly on drawing, and kept a personal journal, in which he at one point wrote, ""I am not gay, although I wish I were, just to piss off homophobes.""

Cobain is a rock god.  He was named the greatest rock n' roll hero of all time by ""NME"" readers in 2006, and he remains one of the most enigmatic and fascinating personalities in the history of popular music.  On the outside, he was a good-looking, hostile, roughly-dressed twenty-something; on the inside, he was fighting an endless battle against his own inner demons.  The thing that separated Cobain from his similarly rude, rebellious peers was this: he cared about the world.  He really did, and he wasn't afraid to admit it.  Much of the immense pain in his life came from his own terror at the state of the world and, in particular, the people in it.  It's evident not only from his many, many quotes, but from his songs themselves.  Rough numbers like the mocking ""In Bloom"" or the woeful ""Lithium"" sound angry and reckless on top, but beneath all the anger there's immense sorrow at the state of things.  The trademark punk madness, juxtaposed with sincere humanism, was one of the most appealing things about Nirvana.

Then there's the lyrics themselves, penned by Cobain.  While rival group Pearl Jam sang, ""I take a walk outside/I'm surrounded by some kids at play/I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?"", Nirvana grumbled lines like, ""When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions,"" or such refrains as, ""Give an inch, take a smile/Fashion shifts, fashion style/Throw it out and keep it in/Have to have poison skin.""  Cobain seemed to be almost rambling as he spewed out line after line of surreal poetry, and though all of it may not mean much - his bandmates attest that most of the lyrics were written within five minutes of their first performance - there sure appeared to be some sort of deeper meaning.  Cobain seemed to be on to something which the rest of the public couldn't quite grasp.

His lyrics wouldn't have been nearly as powerful without the music to back them up.  Songs like ""On a Plain"" were simple enough to catch the public ear, but at the same time, the arrangement of the music added a new and very appealing depth to them.  Despite his aim to wipe the earth clean of the shiny, soulless tunes of the 80s, Cobain loved pop music.  In fact, ""Nevermind""'s most famous song, the inescapable ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" (voted the 9th best song of all time by ""Rolling Stone""), was Cobain's attempt to write the perfect song.  While crafting ""Nevermind,"" he aimed to create the ultimate pop album in the vein of his heroes, the Beatles, one which was modern and catchy enough to obliterate records like Michael Jackson's ""Dangerous"" (number 1 on the charts at that time) but meaningful and spirited enough that the public would grow from listening to it, not step back as they had in the 80s.  Of course, he wanted it to rock, too.

The result was a manic, pounding, rollicking rush of intense rock music.  Bassist Krist Novoselic added an oily murkiness to the tracks, keeping Cobain's edgy, buzzing guitars from taking off, much like Cobain's own darkness prevented him from ever soaring as a public figure (until his death - more on that later).  The band's original drummer, Chad Channing, was fired and replaced with Dave Grohl.  Where Channing just sort of rolled through each song, Grohl was like a hurricane and an earthquake in one thunderous package.  When he drummed, he drummed.  He didn't have the versatility or sheer prowess of drummers like Rush's Neil Peart or Stewart Copeland of the Police, but he could and did pound the hell out of those things, much like the Who's Keith Moon.  In the public eye, Kurt Cobain was Nirvana, but any fan will tell you that Novoselic and Grohl were equally important, the firm, high-velocity support for Cobain's meandering surrealism.

Of Nirvana's three albums, ""Nevermind"" is widely regarded as their masterpiece.  Each of its 12 tracks are gems.  It may be a testament to the album that its lead single, the aforementioned ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" is probably its weakest track.  That song, with others like the rambunctious ""Breed,"" or the purposefully abysmal ""Territorial Pissings,""are pure hard-rocking delights.  The watery guitar on the almost ethereal ""Come As You Are"" is irresistible, while the surprisingly melodic chorus of ""On a Plain,"" or the woeful breeziness of ""Something in the Way,"" are downright ghostly.  While the record may have retained that ghostliness since its release, it's certainly more haunting considering the dark circumstances of Cobain's death.

There is no underlying theme on ""Nevermind.""  It's not conceptually dense or extraodinarily creative, like ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.""  And all these years later, the abundance of Nirvana-wannabes on popular radio have numbed our ears.  But if at first ""Nevermind"" doesn't seem particularly amazing, listen to it again, and then again, and perhaps even again, and to your surprise, you will forget about all those other ""post-grunge"" groups out there and hear the album as the world heard it back in `91 and `92.  What makes ""Nevermind"" so wonderful is, in part, its story: after all, Cobain and his crew had no intentions of blowing the world away when they released the album.  Then there's the music.  ""Nevermind"" is the sound of a band that had something to say, said it, and had a pretty good time saying it too.  It's rowdy, but aware (painfully so, at times); visceral, but sophisticated.  It's amazing that a genre so inherently ugly, punk, can turn out to be so wise and beautiful.  And punk was never more beautiful than Nirvana.

Truly, Nirvana could have been the best and biggest band since the Beatles.  Although the Beatles' debut was a piece of pop perfection, it took them five more albums to craft a genuinely brilliant record.  Nirvana's debut, on the other-hand, was a nasty, black snake of a record, far from brilliant, but certainly promising.  It took them only one more album to generate a masterpiece, though, and their next album, ""In Utero,"" was similarly great.  ""In Utero"" is, perhaps, structurally and conceptually deeper than ""Nevermind,"" and it sounds more like the rough, vomitific rock of ""Bleach"" than the shiny yet slimey rock of ""Nevermind"" (a sound which the band often expressed their disapproval with).  But ""Nevermind"" was their masterpiece, a perfect rock record that spoke to millions of people.  If one considers that all this was done within the course of three albums, it's breathtaking to think what the group may have done had not Cobain been killed.

So if the band could've been so great, what happened?  Well, although Nirvana was the pride and joy of American listeners around 1992, when ""In Utero"" was released in 1993, the public was losing interest.  ""In Utero"" was an album that intentionally challenged its listeners, and considering that most listeners were just getting familiar with its predecessors, that was a challenge they weren't willing to accept.  On top of that, the public was getting sick of Cobain's seemingly incessant depression and disregard for his fans.  He was becoming more and more alienated by the band's sudden popularity, too.  1994 found Cobain seeking a divorce from his wife, Courtney Love (the public frequently called ""Cobain & Love"" the new ""Lennon & Ono""), and even planning to disband Nirvana.

Then he was killed.  The public went mad.  Suddenly everyone loved Nirvana again, and everybody always had.  They were brilliant.  Cobain was immortalized, trapped forever as the dark, troubled 27-year-old lead of one of the greatest bands of all time.  A nation grieved for one of its most promising and talented youth.  How did he die?  Suicide, officially.  The most popular rock music conspiracy is that Cobain didn't kill himself: he was murdered.  He and his band are still discussed in this day, and truthfully, if he hadn't died such a sudden and shocking death, they might not have been remembered so fondly.

Regardless of the history, Nevermind is one hell of an album.  ""Rolling Stone"" ranked it #17 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums, commenting, ""His [Cobain's] slashing riffs, corrosive singing and deviously oblique writing, rammed home by the Pixies-via-Zeppelin might of bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, put the warrior purity back in rock & roll.""  It was ranked the second best album ever on VH1's list (behind the Beatles' ""Revolver""), and has ranked toward the top of countless other ""all-time best"" lists.  Deservedly so.  This is truly one of the finest records ever cut, so fine that it almost single-handedly murdered our nation's obsession with pop.  Unfortunately, Nirvana ended too soon to complete their mission, and so we remain a nation terrifyingly conscious of trashy pop and sickeningly unaware of the good stuff, the real music - stuff like this.","or state characterized by freedom from or oblivion to pain , worry , grunge ( noun ) - dirt , filth , rubbish ; something of inferior quality ; trash . The 1980s were one big , immoral popularity contest . While hard rock had dominated most of the 1970s , the 80s were all about pop : artists like Michael Jackson , Phil Collins , Lionel Ritchie , By 1980 , punk rock , which began in the mid-70s , had evolved into "" new wave , "" spawning groups like Tears for Fears Meanwhile , rock titans like Neil Young seemed to have lost all the edginess that made them so attractive ; Bob Dylan stumbled through the decade , fashioning a couple great albums and releasing a much greater number of duds . Music aficionados were forced to ponder the direst of ponderings : was rock dead ? Whether rock was dead or alive , Nirvana rejuvenated it and brought it back to the forefront , nearly stopping pop in its place . The world had not heard anything so ferocious and reeling with pained awareness since the days of the Sex Pistols , and for a world still feeling hungover from the superficial craze of the 1980s , it was a welcome wake - up call . Nirvana actually emerged at the end of the 80s , led by lead vocalist that Sub Pop was going to become a subsidiary for a major label , they decided to "" cut out the middleman "" "" Grunge "" music , the murky indie - alternative rock played by groups like Soundgarden , Alice in Chains , or , more famously , Pearl Jam , was on the verge of becoming popular . Geffen executives hoped Nirvana could find some fame as one of the better grunge bands . They hoped to sell 250,000 copies of Nirvana 's second effort , 1991 's "" Nevermind , "" earning a "" Gold "" certification from the RIAA ( Recording Industry Association of America ) . The band themselves did not really care . When the record was released in late 1991 , MTV 's late night music video showcase "" 120 Minutes "" began playing "" Smells Like Teen Spirit , "" the album 's lead single . Soon it became so popular that the network began playing it during the day . and in November of ' 91 it entered the Billboard Top 40 at # 35 .   Half of the initial YOU.S. pressings went to the northwest , and was unavailable for days . Finally , in January of 1992 , Nevermind hit # 1 on the Billboard Top 40 . Critical response to the album was decidedly mixed . and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radio 's high - octane hits . "" On the other hand , Robert Christgau , the so - called "" Dean of American Rock Critics , "" gave the album an A.   "" This is hard rock as the term was understood before metal moved in - the kind of loud , slovenly , tuneful music you think no one will ever work a change on again until the next time it happens , "" Christgau wrote . That is exactly what "" Nevermind "" is : a hard rock , post - punk album picking up where the punk groups of the 1970s left off . When Nevermind was released at the beginning of the 90s , despite its cover art depicting a baby pursuing a dollar bill on a fishing hook underwater , it was like a generation coming up for air after being drowned in commercial , spiritless noise for a decade . Nirvana defined its generation like no other , or the band , one must be familiar with its leader : the legendary , quasi - infamous Kurt Cobain . Most people are very familiar with him , due in no small part to his untimely and much - discussed death in 1994 . that looks like something out of "" The Fog . "" Friends Cobain hated athletics ( despite his father signing him up for the local wrestling which Cobain did quite well ) and befriended a gay student , leading to taunts and bullying from Cobain 's peers . He focused mostly on drawing , although I wish I were , just to piss off homophobes . ""

The album is to be listened to as a whole, not in parts...so I wonder why Rolling Stone only gave this masterpiece only three stars when Dylan or Springsteen could spit on the sidewalk, be recorded in 5.1 and given a five star review based on how cool it sounded when it landed.

AOWZ87AGIR2VU,B00MB4DHNU,1,1,5,"This self professed ""Brave And Crazy Man Fan"" finds her latest CD release to be full of her usual passion. To me, her music is about conquering whatever tries to hold you down in life and coming out victorious (she beat breast cancer and now feels more alive than ever!).  Her target audience is still the same, but open minded people can also get into her music if they would only give it a try.

I was first alarmed when I saw all of the writers involved on this one, which can usually be a bad sign. Not so, in this case, since they add diversity and make for a well crafted group of songs. All of the lyrics are obviously from Melissa, since no one else can show that much passion.  A Little Hard Hearted has a strong Beatles influence and A Little Bit Of Me has a bit of a bubbly South African influence to it (and is the only cut that is directed beyond her usual target audience).  All The Way Home is a double entendre about driving a car and sex. There are two songs that contain rap, which I normally hate, but both are done very well here (Monster and Ain't That Bad). I did not find one single song to qualify as a throw away, and every last one made it to my iPod. Can't wait to see her in concert again!","This self professed "" Brave And Crazy Man Fan "" finds her latest CD release to be full of her usual passion . and coming out victorious ( she beat breast cancer and now feels more alive than ever ! ) .

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00EFNXOP6,1,1,4,"Let me state upfront that I am a Gary Numan fan from the early days (starting with Tubeway Army in the late 70s), and it's been a wild ride over the years. After seemingly running out of ideas, Numan released a brilliant album in 2000 called ""Pure"", one of his very best ever. But subsequent albums like ""Hybrid"" and ""Jagged"" didn't really do it for me. Now comes Numan's latest studio album.

""Splinter (Songs From a Broken Mind)"" (12 tracks; 55 min.) starts with a brilliant ""I Am Dust"" and it immediately feels like this album connects to ""Pure"" in many ways. ""Everything Comes Down To This"" comes straight out of the NIN playbook: dark, hard, yet it transfixes you. ""The Calling"" sounds just eerie (and that is meant as a compliment). The best track of the album for me is ""Love Hurt Bleed"" (UK single), which romps and reminds me of Numan's ""Telekon"" album. Yet deeper into the album, another highlight is ""We're The Unforgiven"", with even some danceable beats in it. There are a couple of 'naked' ballads, including ""Lost"" (just Gary and piano for the most part), and the album closer ""My Last Day"". At 55 min. the album runs a bit too long and it is a lot to take it all in at first. But that doesn't take away from the fact that this is clearly Numan's best album since ""Pure"".

Not to date myself, but the first time I saw Gary Numan in concert was in September 28, 1979 at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, on the Pleasure Principle Tour (which would give us the Living Ornaments 1979 live album, still the essential Gary Numan album for me, period). It's a shame that Numan doesn't tour the US more often, the most recent time I saw him live was here in Cincinnati in 2006, already 7 years ago. If you have a chance to see Numan in concert, do not miss him! Meanwhile, ""Splinter (Songs From a Broken Mind"") is a nice addition to the rich and ever-growing catalog of Gary Numan studio albums. A must have for any Numan fan!","that I am a Gary Numan fan from the early days ( starting with Tubeway Army in the late 70s ) , and it is been a wild ride over the years .

This is especially True since Ghetto Classics was just as good as its predecessors, but Jaheim didn't get the push he deserved from his label and failed to chalk up the numbers he used to get in his prime. Now with Atlantic Records as his new label home, Jaheim hopes to re-up and capture the attention of his original fan base and millions more with his new album The Makings Of A Man. He keeps the formula the same for the most part, resorting to mid-tempo grooves and slow cuts for the majority of the album. After professing his worth with the intro track ""Voice of R&B."" Jaheim lays it down with ""Hush,"" a song about keeping an affair with a homie's girl on the low. ""Have You Ever"" rides out with strong background vocals, simple piano work, and lyrics about speculating on what could have been and rethinking what has already been done.

""Life of a Thug"" is a depiction of Jaheim's life in the form of an autobiographical song, describing all the trials and tribulations that he's faced over the years and his ultimate redemption from those trying times. He questions why a lover doesn't realize a good man when he's right in your face on the song ""Just Don't Have A Clue.""

Jaheim gets real on ""What You Think Of That"" where he describes realizing the True essence of a woman who was disrespected and unappreciated by a fool who didn't know what he had. ""Make A Wish"" is a smooth yet simple song about giving his girl whatever she wants and dreams of having, something every woman wishes were True! The album closes with the tender cut ""Back Together Again,"" a tribute to his parents who are now reunited in Heaven. Jaheim took his time with Makings Of A Man, and it truly shows in practically every track.

Many are calling Lazarus (and the full album, Blackstar), his parting gift to fans and the world. The album was released two days before his death.

RIP David Bowie.

A2W9I628I6SE1U,B003ZGMFGI,1,1,4,"It's pretty simple. If you are a fan of OMD, especially any of the albums after their more experimental first several, then you should be pretty pleased with HoM. The MP3 samples on Amazon give you a good idea of what to expect, though they don't really do the songs justice. There is a good mix of very good and decent songs, with only one or two clunkers, but taste is subjective and what I like and dislike, you might not. I think it is great to have the whole band back together again and their recaptured (though slightly modernized) sound is proof that even after the so-so albums of the 90s and 00s, they can recapture the magic that made them special.

Who is this album not for? Well, I don't think it'll win over many first-time listeners. Not that it isn't good, but it does have a retro sound I don't see getting much airplay these days. Also, the limited edition version w/DVD is only for the completest hard-core fans. Everyone else can save a little money and get the standard edition or download.","It is pretty simple .

A3CPA0XGKNY9ZJ,B002QU9O4K,1,1,4,"Prime Cuts:  Little Wood Guitar, City of Silver Dreams, Nuttin' for Christmas

Christmas CDs are a knotty affair:  almost every successful artist is mandated to release one yuletide offering nowadays whether or not the set is birthed from the heart.  With 5 number 1 hits, 3 multi-platinum albums, and a prime time TV special, success certainly has been a close relative of Sugarland.  And like many country superstars, they have been lobbied by their record company to cut a seasonal effort as a stop-gap album in lieu of a brand new studio CD this year.  Yet, this duo has not treated this as a contractual CD.  Rather, on this hybrid effort, they have invested 5 original tunes, some of which are among their most heartfelt compositions.  Even when they tackle the seasonal chestnuts, they have endorsed their interpretations with innovative creativity.  Bursting the seams of genre classifications, these 10 cuts are made so much more interesting with doses of r & b, jazz, pop, country rock as well as even some traces of bluegrass.

The set's opener ""City of Silver Dreams"" is an instant heart grabber--a polished country pop ballad about a wide-eyed country girl's first Christmas in the urban jungle of New York City.  Jennifer Nettles' heartfelt delivery emotes in convincing ways the loneliness of being homesick that truly staggers the heart.  ""Little Wood Guitar,"" written by Ellis Paul and Kristian Bush, is a finely honed narrative piece telling the story of how a girl's life changed since she received a guitar as her only gift one Christmas.  Yet not is syrupy sentimental; Sugarland shows that they know how to have fun with ""Nuttin' for Christmas.""  Cute, fun, and definitely catchy--Nettles truly sounds like she's having fun and easily ""Nuttin' for Christmas"" would rock well in the ranks of classics such as ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" and ""Jingle Bells.""  However, not all the originals are of that lofty in standard:  ""Maybe Baby"" sounds like a track from their standard album with ""Christmasy"" references tagged on.  While ""Coming Home"" is pretty average this time finding the duo in r&b territory with a light touch of Gospel.

As for the seasonal favourites, Sugarland does step out of the tried and tested box.  This duo gives ""Winter Wonderland"" a country boogie makeover that is infectious.  While most renditions of ""O Come O Come Emanuel"" are dirge-like slow, Sugarland offers a bluegrassy take of this hymn making it sound like a rootsy Southern Gospel revival number.  Never to be restrained by the language barrier, ""Silent Night"" is sung bilingually in both English and Spanish.  This time ""Silent Night"" finds Jennifer Nettles trading lines with Kristian Bush making one wish they would sing more duets together.  Kristian Bush again returns to the microphone to sing lead on ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" which is quite jovial without being exceptional.

Relative to most Christmas CDs out there, ""Gold and Green"" shows personality.  More than just a holiday album, this is very much a Sugarland record.  They have left their patented mark all over.  Even the traditional old favourites have been re-vamped.  However, like their studio albums, with the originals coming mostly from their own pens, some of them become pretty average pop country efforts.  Other than that, ""Gold and Green"" is much more than your average sonic ornament.","With 5 number 1 hits , 3 multi - platinum albums , and a prime time TV special , success certainly has been a close relative of Sugarland .

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Loves a game, want to play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00DUFE30U,1,1,4,"One thing to be said about Chante Moore is she's always had the pedigree for huge creative success. A love for jazz and a heavy gospel back round have given her a powerfully rangey vocal instrument that lends itself wonderfully to the highest form of interpretation to both original material and even the songs of others if needed. Also having been in the glamour profession as a model ala' Whitney Houston helped in the image department. However when I hear one of her songs on the radio or these days on YouTube my feelings for her are always the same: being presented with a tremendous vocal talent that is constantly pandering to every cliched hip-hop/soul trend that comes along in terms of being a composer. I only had ever bought her debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Precious/dp/B000002OKZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Precious</a>&nbsp;before this-hoping the level of musical chutzpah she showcases on her collaborations with other artists would fulfill itself more strongly when she made another of her comebacks-a term I use since her albums always come fairly few and far between. In the end,lets just say there is a direction presented here.

  ""Baby Can I Touch You In The Rain"" is not a bad way to open the album at all-delivering a piano driven jazzy-soul number with strong pop craft involved. ""Talking In My Sleep"" is strong melodically as well as musically-with a vocally appropriate use of the 2-step dance/hip-hop beat that's...yes has been more than overused and dull for several years now to me but this song uses it well. ""Alone"" is a deep,throbbing and bass heavy funk jam of the sort I've never heard from Chante' before-not to say she's never done them. Combined as it with with more strong song-craft,its impressive enough to be a personal favorite here. The sad ""Don' Make Me Laugh"" and ""Giving You Always"" are nuanced and relaxed ballad type songs instrumentally-Chante's vocals going from cooing to gospel/soul/jazz fire as the song builds. ""Doctor Doctor"" references the horn part of Sam Cooke's ""Shake"" for a contemporary production of a mid 60's uptempo gospel/soul workout and is another personal favorite of mine here.

  ""Mrs. Under, Stood"" uses some interesting wordplay with a very chunky mid tempo funk/pop groove. ""On And On"",the only collaboration here with Da Brat is my least favorite song here. Its a high powered and repetitious electro dance/pop number that adds nothing particularly new to the genre-even Chante's gospel power which,by the way is used to greater effect on the more live jazz instrumental sounding gospel workout ""Jesus I Want You"". The album concludes with her interpretation of ""Cry Me A River""-a number that lives up to Chante's vocal talents. Overall this is an excellent album outside of one song that deducts it a start for me-which came off like an easy way to get radio airplay when pop music is still trying to resolve an extremely shallow and condescending period. As for Chante' Moore herself she delivers a consistently strong album for the most part. One could nit pick on it not being exactly transcendent. But starting out as a recording artist in the 1990's,when few popular artists had developed a well rounded musical back-round for an enduring appeal,she's proven herself more than versatile and talented to weather whatever musical storm she has been caught up in her career.","One thing to be said about Chante Moore is she is always had the pedigree for huge creative success .

AADJXNY9HSKJF,B001F3FZVK,1,1,4,"This was probably the smost unexpected hit album of 1999 *maybe tied with Santana.* Cher hadn't had a gold album or decent hit single since 1991 and the ""Love Hurts"" album along with the top 20 hit ""Love and Understanding."" She had some minor success with the ""It's A Man's World"" album in 1996, but unfortunately, it didn't go anywhere. Then in 1998, Cher released her dance/pop masterpiece ""Believe"" and it became a worldwide smash. Here in the US, the single became her 4th solo #1 hit and was the #1 single of 1999. The album ""Believe"" was a smash too hitting the top 5 on the album charts and going 4x platinum.
Of course, the star of the album is the title track. The song is perfection, plain and simple. However, the hidden gem is ""All Or Nothing."" Although it was a club hit, this song should've been huge. It's a great dance track and has a great chorus. ""Strong Enough"" was a moderate hit for Cher also and has a great disco sound to it. ""Runaway"" is a good listen too along with ""Taxi Taxi."" ""Love Is the Groove"" is cool too but it's a bit repititive. Ending the album is a remix of her 80's hit ""We All Sleep Alone."" It's nothing special and I enjoy the original more.

It really was a surprise that I really enjoyed that does showcase that definitely was a strong escape away from all the joke artists like Rihanna and Kelly Clarkson.

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B019KKBQVC,1,1,5,"About five years ago,I got seriously into the whole Daptone label music scene. The whole theme they had was very authentically retro. It wasn't just the instrumental style of the music that came out of it. It was the sound of the recordings,even the old school film based photographic style of cover art. Charles Bradley is their key male solo artist. And his chief musical influence was James Brown-even working part time impersonating the man. As for me I have his first two albums. And was very excited to pick up his third when it came out. Again,there's no disappointment.

The album opens with a partially spoken word,organ/piano based version of ""God Bless America"" where Bradly discussed the pros and cons of being black in this country. ""Good To Be Back Home"" is stomping,bluesy funk with phat electric guitar and horn accents throughout. ""Nobody But You"",the title song,""Crazy For Your Love"" and the closer ""Slow Love"" are all reverbed guitar heavy ballads while ""Ain't Gonna Give You Up"" is a thick,slow deep funk groove with a bee like synthesizer buzzing. ""Things We Do For Love"" is a brightly melodic uptempo gospel/soul number filled with multiple backup singers and ""You Think I Don't Know (But I Know"" has the same vibe about it. ""Change For The World"" is an brief late 60's/early 70's Ike Hayes like psychedelic funk message song warning about the revival of segregationist racial behavior.

In a lot of ways,this might just be the very best album Charles Bradley has made thus far. The backup instrumentation of instrumentals such as the Budos Band provide a sound that is squarely in both the deep Southern soul and psychedelic funk sound of the late 60's. The vocals and arrangements are full of enormous drama as well. Bradley's voice,especially on his impassioned howls,are echoed intensely throughout nearly every song here. With a large focus on uptempo songs,this really brings out the full power of what this artist has had to offer up musically from his very outset.","About five years ago , I got seriously into the whole Daptone label music scene .

Hayloft is a bit of an odd choice. I am not sure if it was done tongue in cheek, like when they used to do Brittany Spears' Toxic live. It is curious, but kind of fun, & funny.

A3CPA0XGKNY9ZJ,B0128GGLIS,1,1,4,"Prime Cuts: Beautiful Offerings, Come Sit Down, Good Good Father

When Big Daddy Weave named their much anticipated seventh studio album ""Beautiful Offerings,"" it's not hyperbole. These songs are truly ""beautiful"" in the sense that they are contemplative, reflective, and deftly crafted with lyrics that scratches behind the superficial veneer.  And they are ""offerings,"" in the sense that they are paeans of our heartfelt struggles and praises offered as worship to the Almighty God.  Rather than going the steely EDM gauze route, they have opted to let the acoustics of warmer instruments such as the acoustic guitar, banjos, and the gentle pull of strings pave a more tepid feel for what is Big Daddy Weave's most reflective record.  This is not to say that this album has no feet moving moments, it's just that ballads are at fore this time round.

Big Daddy Weave is one of the top artists in Christian music: they are one of the genre's biggest headlining artists, the second most played artist at Christian AC-Monitored radio in 2014 and the recipient of multiple industry awards and nominations, including: Dove Awards, K-LOVE Fan Awards, Billboard Music Awards and ASCAP Awards. With a brand-new studio album, entitled Beautiful Offerings, coming September 18, 2015, the band's latest and career best-selling album, Love Come To Life, celebrated four consecutive No. 1 singles along with recent news that ""Redeemed"" has been certified gold by the RIAA. Big Daddy Weave has career album sales of more than one million units. Formed in 2002, Big Daddy Weave is: Mike Weaver, Jay Weaver, Jeremy Redmon, Joe Shirk, and Brian Beihl.

With an orchestrated grandeur of strings leading the way, the title cut ""Beautiful Offerings"" is worship at its best.  Rather than coming to God with a puff-up chest, ""Beautiful Offerings"" finds a broken protagonist coming with his tatters to God for healing again.  ""My Story,"" co-written by Mike Weaver and uber songwriter Jason Ingram, is a powerhouse testimony of God's transformative grace wrapped in the fabric of a True-to-life narrative.  ""Lion and the Lamb"" is perhaps this record's theological heavyweight.  It wrestles with the Biblical image of how the Savior is both the lion as well as the lamb; a thought that can blow our minds to nothing but worship.  Mike Weaver gets the most intimate with his emotionally nuanced rasp on the piano-led ""Come Sit Down.""

However, tedium does make a cameo two thirds into the record.  The predominance of overwrought ballads coming perhaps from a small cluster of songwriters has a way of making some of the songs sound similar especially when you are listening to the record for the first few times.  The songs are not ropey; it's just that some of the songs are easy for our concentration to slide.  However, if you do purchase the deluxe version the to-be classic ""Good Good Father"" gives some traction as it gets us singing along with the guys.  And deluxe version's penultimate track ""Jesus I Believe"" is a not-to-be-missed: it is honest, gripping, and so Christ-focused.  ""Beautiful Offerings"" may have its weak spots, but at least it lives up to its titular.  The majority of the songs are beautiful and a pleasing offering to Jesus.","Prime Cuts : Beautiful Offerings , Come Sit Down , Good Good Father When Big Daddy Weave named their much anticipated seventh studio album "" Beautiful Offerings , "" it is not hyperbole .

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B005F1WJ62,1,1,4,"I had heard about this all-girls country super-star band, which includes country superstar Miranda Lambert, along with Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley, but I hadn't heard a single song, until now. I'm not particulary a country music fan to be honest, but I am a fan of great music, whatever the genre. The other day I was browsing my local library and curiosity got the better of me and I picked this up. Boy, am I glad I did!

""Hell on Heels"" (10 tracks; 30 min.) starts off with the title track, and the best track on here. The song is a delicious musical mash-up of country and sliding guitars reverb, and not to mention the choice lyrics (""I'm gonna break me a million hearts/I'm hell on heels/Sugar daddy, I'm coming for you""). After that, the album's musical vibe is more country-traditional, and that's fine, as it all sounds smooth and I really enjoy as the songs roll along. Several other outstanding tracks for me include ""Boys From the South"" and ""Trailer for Rent"" (with this rip: ""It's been ten years, ten thousand beers/And he's still sittin right there on the couch"" OUCH!).

At 30 min., this album flies by in no time, and you'll play this again and again. This album is nothing short of a pleasant surpise to me. Would love to see these ladies live in concert at some point. Meanwhile, ""Hell on Heels"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","I had heard about this all - girls country super - star band , I am not particulary a country music fan to be honest , but I am a fan of great music , whatever the genre . and curiosity got the better of me Boy , am I glad I did !

A3T9IX8EDFDX4G,B0057PSUZA,1,1,4,"No heavy metal band was as consistently great in the 1980's as Iron Maiden and Somewhere in Time is another strong album from the British band. This was released in 1986 when some of the traditional heavy metal bands (most notably Judas Priest) started experimenting with keyboards or guitar synthesizers. While this style didn't work for Priest (who overdid the guitar synthesizers to the point of making them sound like a pop band), it worked for Iron Maiden because they used this sound more for color rather than making it their foundation. ""Wasted Years"" would be the first single/video and is one of their best as it has a memorable guitar line and dare I say, a very catchy chorus. The mid-tempo ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" was nearly as good and has become one of their best deep cuts. ""Caught Somewhere In Time"" was another in a long line of musically challenging opening cuts performed at a frenetic pace (the band's opening tracks were the best of the genre, bar none). The highlights continue throughout the album as ""Sea of Madness"" is a riveting track that slows down briefly before coming back harder while ""Heaven Can Wait"" starts out quite somber with Steve Harris's bass synth line before becoming a classic metal track that changes tempos throughout yet it all fits. Other highlights include the killer epic ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" and the wicked unison guitar lines that carry ""Dj Vu"". The last track, ""Alexander the Great"", while musically ambitious, doesn't touch the rest of the album.  All told, Somewhere in Time is another strong album from a band that had a ton of them.","No heavy metal band was as consistently great in the 1980 's as Iron Maiden and Somewhere in Time is another strong album from the British band . when some of the traditional heavy metal bands ( most notably Judas Priest ) started experimenting with keyboards While this style did not work for Priest ( who overdid the guitar synthesizers to the point of making them sound like a pop band ) , it worked for Iron Maiden "" Wasted Years "" would be the first single / video and is one of their best as it has a memorable guitar line and dare I say , a very catchy chorus .

Send Me On My Way has both an earthy and upbeat vibe that is a combination of what sounds to be world, folk, and alternative rock music. I admit that I tried to look up the meaning of the song online but more or less got that it is a happy vibe type of song (from what I deduce on songfacts).

He threw everything he had into the song and it came out as a larger than life anthem.  He wanted to recreate Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, but this wall is on steroids.  The song is a full on blast to your senses with horns, swirling organs, glockenspiels and maybe even an actual kitchen sink thrown in.  The song was released in advance of the album and made a respectable showing of #23 on the Billboard Hot 100.  It marked the only appearance of drummer Ernest ""Boom"" Carter on a studio track by Mr. Springsteen and the last appearance of keyboardist David Sancious for almost twenty years when he ended up playing on a couple of Human Touch tracks.","and maybe even an actual kitchen sink thrown in . and made a respectable showing of # 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 .

But if you were to fall asleep while this CD is playing, you'd miss some great music. The book from which Shawn selected these carols and lullabies obviously contains many songs that are rarely heard these days, making this particularly interesting for those looking for something different, though there one song here that is famous all around the world - Silent night, which works as a lullaby as well as a carol.

The opening track, In the bleak midwinter, is a wonderful old English carol and it's great to hear this sung by an American - a rare occurrence. Rocking is another old English carol, one that is particularly suited to this album, being both a holiday song and a lullaby. All through the night is a carol I've heard before but recordings of it seem to be even rarer than Rocking and In the bleak midwinter.

Elsewhere, there are beautiful songs such as Windy nights (words by Robert Louis Stevenson), All the pretty li'l horses, Little road to Bethlehem and Love came down at Christmas. The final track is Close your eyes, so it seems that Shawn really does want you to fall asleep after that.

This is definitely not a typical Christmas album but very soothing - and very satisfying.","that might send you to sleep if you are in any way tired .

A1432KCCCZL550,9714721180,1,1,5,"If you're new to Metallica, this and the follow up, Master Of Puppets, are the albums to get, if you're a metal fan anyways. these 2 are hands down their best.

For an, at the time, little known metal band, the production is really good. Everyone is in top form. James's vocals are a little higher than they'd be after this album, which adds to the charm of this album. The band was driven. they had some good material, partly thanks to Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine. And they put together a flawless album worthy of every metal fan's attention.

Fight Fire With Fire 10/10 - starts off with an acoustic intro that fades out as the electric guitars fade in. All this to lead into possibly the fastest Metallica song ever. This is a perfect opener with great guitar work, and vocals. this is definitely in a long list of favorite songs by Metallica, which every song with lyrics on this album actually are on.

Ride The Lightning 9/10 is an upper mid tempo song with solid vocals and a nice riff in the verses. Plus a catchy chorus. Overall a very good song.

For Whom The Bell Tolls 10/10 might be my favorite Metallica song ever. Granted it has stiff competition, but it might be. This one has a nice groove to it. This one's still fairly heavy, but not as heavy as the past 2 songs. There are some good melodies, and the guitar playing is really good. I hate to give credit to Lars, but his drums really add power to this song.

Fade To Black 9/10 is the first Metallica ballad. It starts with an acoustic guitar with some electric leads. It doesn't really have a chorus, just a riff, instrumental based chorus, similar to what Black Sabbath did a lot. And it works fine. The first 2 verses are slow ballad acoustic style, then the song speeds up for the bridge and solo. Overall a very good song.

Trapped Under Ice 9/10 after a ballad, what do any good metal bands do? They come back with a fast paced thrasher, which is what they did here. This is the second fastest song on the album. The song has a nice pace to it, and is an overall fun listen.

Escape 9/10 is kind of the pop song of the album. Odd it gets no recognition. This is probably the catchiest song on the album. This one's similar pacing to Ride The Lightning. It has a really good chorus, and is yet another in a long list of great songs on here.

Creeping Death 10/10 is another contender for favorite Metallica song. It's a fairly fast paced thrasher with a great horus. It has some slower parts as well and is a great way to close out the album.

Then there's an instrumental which I won't rate because I'm not really into instrumentals. It's played just fine, so I'm sure for fans of them it'll do.

Overall if you're a metal fan new to Metallica, which would be surprising, this is a good place to start. You won't be disappointed.","and the follow up , Master Of Puppets , are the albums to get , if you are a metal fan anyways . these 2 are hands down their best .

These are good performances in pretty good, but variable, sound quality. The Utah Symphony, though not one of the world's top-flight orchestras, always played their hearts out for Abravanel. The big attraction here are the concerto performances of Ponti and Rosand, with the extreme rarity of a complete performance of Tchaikovsky's third piano concerto, which was completed, as they say, by another hand.

For a little more money ($2.19), you can purchase ""Tchaikovsky - Rise of the Masters,"" another digital download on Amazon that will net you all of the symphonies, a couple of the concerti, and some other nice works not found here.

Yes Leon's destinctive piano often sits on top of the mix, and the strings and backing female voices occationaly over power King's playing and mar and date the arrangements, but it's soooo good, even if it is at the end of the road for Freddie.
.
I'd suggest picking up the 2-disc ""KING OF THE BLUES"".
That CD contains all of these cuts and then some; about 60 in all, in a generous package.  There are only a handful of songs that are not up to par and some that are so good you will wonder why you did not already have King in your blues collection.

Yes Leon 's destinctive piano often sits on top of the mix , and backing female voices occationaly over power King 's playing and mar but it is soooo good , even if it is at the end of the road for Freddie . That CD contains all of these cuts and then some ; about 60 in all , in a generous package . that are so good you will wonder"

While the song is short and simple, the grip from Michael's voice into the song still ignites. I honestly found this song to be one of their best, and it still is just as haunting today, as it was when it came out in the late 80's. While INXS has tried to come back with another singer, J.D. Fortune and with Switch, that didn't work very well. If you really are nee to INXS, and have never heard one single song from the rock group from ""Down Under"", than this song would be a fantastic song to to get.

A3H8UAHSDIBI5H,B00Q7SKT28,1,1,4,"It appears that some people were expecting this much revered, well-seasoned musical legend to take a miraculous lozenge and suddenly have the chirping voice of a Michael Buble. This is not an artist willing to be auto-tuned, filtered, and vocal-quantized so he can sound sonically airbrushed. He is instead grabbing these old chestnuts by the chest,(the heart, that is, so as not to be tasteless) and singing them like the ragged survivor he truly is. What a career! This man was strumming Pete Seeger songs and ""Blowin' in the Wind"" when I was in grade school. Why do I want to hear him croak out an album of timeless standards now? Simple: because he's REAL and all the computer-generated, sterile music being churned out nowadays can't hold a torch song to a genuine romantic who is the epitome of a real artist. It may surprise some to know that I am not even much of a Dylan fan. I have in fact only bought a few of his albums including his greatest hits and the haunting ""Time Out of Mind"". However, I was drawn to this album immediately. It's coolly subdued and minimalistic, blue as any great blues album, and naked as a featherless jay- bird shivering in a tree at the onset of winter. It's classy, anti-bombast for not only reflective boomers but anyone who appreciates timeless songs and wants an aural sex break from the oddly anxious and bombastic pop hits currently getting their 15 minutes of radio fame. Here's hoping it's only mid to late Autumn (Leaves and all) for a man whose voice has been a part of our lives for so long.

A1TW69BJTUFG6S,B00168G2M0,1,1,4,"To say this is a curious album for the Rolling Stones is a bit of an understatement.  Mick Taylor had just recently left the band (he joined as replacement of the band's founding member, Brian Jones, in 1969), and his replacement had not yet been selected.  So what do you do when you're the biggest and baddest rock 'n' roll band on the planet?  You host auditions and record the whole darn thing, that's what!  Among the hopeful new guitarists were Rory Gallagher, Steve Marriott, Jeff Beck, Harvey Mandel, Wayne Perkins, Peter Frampton, and Ronnie Wood, though only Harvey, Wayne, and Ronnie's work would appear on the subsequent album.

Stylistically, the band found themselves at another crossroad.  Though the majority of the album sticks True to their electric blues roots, there are also elements of reggae (see ""Cherry Oh Baby"") and jazz (see ""Melody""), which were pretty far out of the band's usual playbook.  And yet they managed to incorporate these different styles as only the Rolling Stones can do:  with balls and bravado.  Opening with ""Hot Stuff"" followed by ""Hand Of Fate,"" the door gets kicked in pretty heavily before the gears shift for their cover of Eric Donaldson's ""Cherry Oh Baby.""  Side 1 closes with the slow blues burn of ""Memory Motel"" where both Mick and Keith contributed lead vocals to a love song embedded within a tale of life on the road.

Side 2 opens with ""Hey Negrita,"" another bluesy-rock number, then shifts to the bluesy-jazz ""Melody,"" which features the piano work of Billy Preston rather prominently.  ""Fool To Cry,"" the album's second single, follows before closing out with the rockin' ""Crazy Mama.""  Overall, Black And Blue is a solid addition to the Stones already stellar catalog, but it doesn't hold as much reverence as, say, albums like Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, or Exile On Main St.  But when you record some of the all-time greatest rock 'n' roll records back to back to back, don't you deserve a little time off?  A chance to step back and try something a little different?  I think that's what Black And Blue is all about, a chance for the Stones to step out of their comfort zone and try something a little different.

If all you know of the Rolling Stones is their greatest hits albums, you'll recognize ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Fool To Cry"" from Jump Back.  In my opinion, the strongest outings on this album are ""Hot Stuff,"" ""Hand Of Fate,"" and ""Crazy Mama""; these are what I would consider to be the *essential* tracks on Black And Blue.  ""Cherry Oh Baby"" and ""Hey Negrita"" are pretty cool to listen to, and ""Memory Motel"" and ""Melody"" and excellent ""late night"" tracks for relaxin' at home.  I'm not a huge fan of ""Fool To Cry,"" though; it reminds me too much of ""Angie,"" and I tend to skip it whenever I listen to the album.  But overall, this is an album worth having whether or not you're out to collect the entire Stones catalog; if nothing else, it makes an excellent bookend (but in a good way).","To say this is a curious album for the Rolling Stones is a bit of an understatement . Among the hopeful new guitarists were Rory Gallagher , Steve Marriott , Jeff Beck , Harvey Mandel , Wayne Perkins , Peter Frampton , and Ronnie 's work would appear on the subsequent album . Though the majority of the album sticks True to their electric blues roots , there are also elements of reggae ( see "" Cherry Oh Baby "" ) which were pretty far out of the band 's usual playbook . and bravado . Opening with "" Hot Stuff "" followed by "" Hand Of Fate , "" the door gets kicked in pretty heavily before the gears shift for their cover of Eric Donaldson 's "" Cherry Oh Baby . "" Side 1 closes with the slow blues burn of "" Memory Motel "" and Keith contributed lead vocals to a love song embedded within a tale of life on the road . Side 2 opens with "" Hey Negrita , "" another bluesy - rock number , then shifts to the bluesy - jazz "" Melody , "" which features the piano work of Billy Preston rather prominently . "" Fool To Cry , "" the album 's second single , follows before closing out with the rockin ' "" Crazy Mama . "" And Blue is a solid addition to the Stones already stellar catalog , but it does not hold as much reverence as , say , albums like Beggars Banquet , Let It Bleed , Sticky Fingers , or Exile On Main St. when you record some of the all - time greatest rock ' n ' roll records back to back to back , do not you deserve a little time off ? A chance to step back And Blue is all about , a chance for the Stones to step out of their comfort zone If all you know of the Rolling Stones is their greatest hits albums , you will recognize "" Hot Stuff "" and "" Fool To Cry "" from Jump Back . In my opinion , the strongest outings on this album are "" Hot Stuff , "" "" Hand Of Fate , "" and "" Crazy Mama "" ; these are what I would consider to be the * essential * tracks on Black and "" Hey Negrita "" are pretty cool to listen to , and excellent "" late night "" tracks for relaxin ' at home . I am not a huge fan of "" Fool To Cry , "" though ; it reminds me too much of "" Angie , "" But overall , this is an album worth having whether or not you are out to collect the entire Stones catalog ; if nothing else , it makes an excellent bookend ( but in a good way ) ."

Its different from what his fans are accustomed to but its a good listen. A lot of guest appearances by recent rappers as opposed to the clan and old school cats. Ghost drops in on the first track and that's the best one on the album (4 In Da Morning). I think the direction for this album is needed. Its not raw and gritty like his previous work so I think this may appeal to more newcomers and tap into a new market. Good production, short album and a decent body of work. Its time he gets some money. Cop it I say, support some good rap and add to your collection.

The next two tracks, Missing You and 8th Avenue Serenade are as solid as any song from the previous  Green Day releases. Drama Queen gets the band back into the power ballad territory, however,  with the following four tracks Kid, Sex, Drugs & Violence, Little Boy Named Train and Amanda-, Green Day sounds  even more stronger than at the beginning of this album. Walk Away takes the band , once again, to the balladry territory, only to return to the energetic punk of Dirty Rotten Bastards-a  6 min and a half  punk epic similar in vein to that of Jesus of Suburbia- and 99 Revolutions, which in my humble opinion, has to be the best track on this album. The Forgotten closes up the album in a slow paced manner. In fact, it is probably one of the most melodic, polished  tracks of this CD. Overall, &iexcl;Tr&eacute;!

AGOIS4LC6AY9I,B006J2FKXK,1,1,5,"I gave it a few weeks before logging into amazon and posting an impuslive review of this cd. I have lived in Las Vegas for 8 years, and have always hated the kids here (Meaning hardcore, punk, emo, alternative rock kids, etc). That's why I was surprised when I heard the Killers first CD. While I liked Hot Fuss a lot, there were only a few songs that I kept in my Itunes library. There were a lot of throwaway songs I thought. On This CD, almost every song is good. I fell in love with the ""When you were young"" song and was not let down on the rest. It's a good cd that reminds me of every band I've ever loved put in a blender. I hear the Misfits sometimes (just a little), the Smiths, Depeche Mode. Sometimes it sounds like Placebo. It has almost a religious, weird choir music feel to it at times which I think is great. People say it sounds like Bruce Springsteen. I don't hear that, but whatever. If you're not a judgmental indie rock nerd who wants to put down a great band because you're unable to produce music this good, buy this cd.

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B002TJK7E4,1,1,4,"After the release of the Strokes' third album ""First Impressions of Earth"" and the subsequent tour, the band went on an unofficial hiatus which is still lasting to this day. But it provided the various members an opportunity to stretch their musical legs. My favorite comes from Albert Hammond Jr. who has issued two albums, one better than the other: ""Yours to Keep"" in 2007 and ""Como Te Llama"" in 2008. Now singer-songwriter Julias Casablancas joins the fray and issues his own solo album amidst high expectations.

""Phrazes For the Young"" (8 tracks; 40 min.) is the classic case of a traditional A and B side to the vinyl album of old. The first 4 songs make up Side A and the opener ""Out of the Blue"" is by far the most commercially sounding track on here, and somewhat reminiscent of the classic Strokes sound of strumming electric guitars. ""Left & Right in the Dark"" and ""11th Dimension"" also are quite pleasant to the ear. Side A concludes with a pensive ""4 Cords of the Apocalypse"". As the next 4 song cycle gets underway, it made me realize that the further you go along in the album, the less and less it sounds like the Strokes, so for anyone expecting a Strokes album in all-but-name, save your money and don't buy this. Side B starts with a strangely mesmerizing ""Ludlow St."", bringing a hotchpotch of sounds with brass, Eastern influences and more, but somehow it works great. ""River of Brakelights"" and ""Glass"" continues the now-ever stranger journey with yet more enticing musical adventures. By the time we get to the closing track ""Tourist"", a mid-tempo track with gorgeous musical layering that feels like a catharsis. It is my second favorite track on the album and a great way to close out the album.

Don't make too much about there ""only"" being 8 tracks on here. They are all around the 5 min. mark, and I never felt that this was a ""Strokes-like"" short album. In a recent music magazine interview of Casablancas, I read that he has high hopes for mainstream-commercial success for this album, which truly surprised me, I mean, really?. I can see one track, tops, getting some commercial radio airplay, and even that is doubtful, given the sorry state of commercial radio. Not that this reflects poorly on this album, not at all. If you are not looking for a carbon-copy Strokes-like album, I venture you will be very pleasantly surprised. I know I certainly have been.","After the release of the Strokes ' third album "" First Impressions of Earth "" But it provided the various members an opportunity to stretch their musical legs .

I think it will take a few years before these guys hit their stride, but this debut has enough diversity and quality to leave you very satisfied. They might end up being too ""English"" for American tastes, but for me they really nailed it. Starting out with high energy numbers like ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor"" and ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"" set you up for a completely up tempo CD and then comes the quiet thoughtful reading of ""Riot Van,"" where the tune totally belies the lyrics. Either the humor is spot on, in titles like ""Perhaps Vampires is a bit Strong..."" which is definitely not the sentiment in the song; or wicked social commentary is clearly expressed on songs like ""When The Sun Goes Down.""  The band does a good job on both types. The only drawback is the music can occasionally get a bit repetitive with the same pounding guitars and drums for a few too many songs, but that's a minor complaint compared to what this band brings to the table; a fresh approach.","This very British band is just an amazing mix of driving beats , vocals filled with whatever emotion is required of them , that take on a number of subjects that usually require a more mature voice to be this good . but this debut has enough diversity and quality to leave you very satisfied .

A1VQ6M4I3JD0EZ,B00WL9MD6M,-1,1,4,"On its own merits, this album is dope and worth copping, esp. if you're a Wu, Ghost, or Raekwon head. Adrian Younge and Ghost mesh well, and you won't find these kinds of sounds or this sort of narrative concept anywhere else in hip hop. I'm psyched by the level of creativity, originality, and general don't-give-a-f-ness that we're seeing in Wu veterans like Ghost and Inspectah Deck (via Czarface).

As a follow-up to part 1, I think this album falls a little short. Whereas a much broader cast of Wu-Tang players came through and crushed it on part 1, this time Raekwon is the only other Wu-Tang member to drop in. As a result, this album lacks the diversity and energy of the first. Go back to part 1 and listen to Deck and Masta Killa's verses. Listen to U-God just come out of nowhere and spazz out on ""Murder Spree.""

But for Kelly Clarkson, she honestly hasn't been able to make music sound all her own so well. That actually is proof of her latest single, Already Gone, the 3rd single from her latest album All I Ever Wanted isn't really a song that feels like it is original. Actually, if you honestly get a closer listen to the song, it actually sounds a bit too similar in its melody like Beyonce's recent song Halo. I really am not that fully impressed with Kelly's latest, not only that, but it also is a bit dissapointing. It doesn't bring out the heart on other recent songs, like Whitney Houston's elequent I Look To You. I really definitely think Kelly Clarkson should try and find better songs to make her own, than feeling like she is copying someone else.

A1O3PKMZLBRUQN,B001NDLQTW,-1,1,4,"Coming into fame as a comedic actor, Jamie Foxx has expanded his horizons to take on a variety of dramatic roles. As a singer who's taken the opportunity to perform in works such as the musical film 'Dreamgirls', his interests include neo-soul styles as well as club-focused hip-hop and even a bit of new jack swing. This album doesn't just bring him together with collaborators such as Kanye West and T.I., though, but frequently buries his talented voice with a lot of slick production.

Foxx's scattershot approach could've made for a well-rounded album, but it feels more like a mixed bag than anything. Some tracks have a particular appeal to them while others seem more average than anything. ""Blame It"" became a major radio hit at the time of release, although as a pop rap single it's nothing special. Foxx's vocal abilities shine far better in songs such as the Boyz II Men style emotional ballads ""Rainman"" and ""Why"", the two of which alone make the album worth picking up.","Coming into fame as a comedic actor , Jamie Foxx has expanded his horizons to take on a variety of dramatic roles . who is taken the opportunity to perform in works such as the musical film ' Dreamgirls ' , his interests include neo - soul styles as well as club - focused hip - hop but frequently buries his talented voice with a lot of slick production .

A2R9CA3YT1WUNV,B00AO7CE6C,1,1,5,"Now What?! is the nineteenth full-length studio album by the legendary British Rock band Deep Purple, it was their third studio album with Don Airy on Keyboards and their fifth with Steve Morse on guitar. It was produced by Bob Ezrin and released in 2013.

On very first listen, a lot of the album washed over me, leaving a generally positive, but honestly not too impressed or interested impression. With repeat listens however, it revealed itself to be not only a passable, or even above average affair, but a genuinely good one, with literally no weak tracks. It's a grower for sure.

Usually, I really enjoy any Deep Purple album, and have enjoyed most Morse era albums to some extent, however sometimes they can feel like there is a bit of filler, or there's a minor lack of consistency, stopping the albums feeling as great as the old days even when over half the album has some genuinely great songs. Now What?! is the perfect Morse era album, it all fits perfectly together, there's variety yet consistency and all the songs are as good as the very best tracks on another Morse era album.

Highlights include the symphonic `Uncommon Man' dedicated to the late Jon Lord, which feels like a mixture between Close To The Edge era Yes with Works era ELP, the energetic and memorable `Apres Vous' which has a very catchy chorus, and the interesting and characterful single `Vincent Price' although to be honest its all great.

The only real negative thing I can think to say is that the track order may undersell the album's both power and variety. I listen to this record a lot but I often choose to listen to the record on random/shuffle now, and always find it a great and exciting album all the more for having done so, but that's just personal preference, most people have no problems with that running order. Seriously, it's a great album; the rhythm section are tight and steady, Airy and Morse make a real impact and Ian Gillan fits into his older vocal style more comfortably here than ever.

Overall; Now What?! is a very good album from the veteran Rock band, easily in the top fifty percent of their catalogue. It's a well produced and well written collection of interesting songs, with a great sense of subtly, musicianship and even a few surprises. Check it out if you like Deep Purple, and especially if you've liked their modern output. And if you do check it out, don't just listen to it once, give it a good few spins and really let it sink in, you'll thank yourself for it after a while.","Now What ? ! is the nineteenth full - length studio album by the legendary British Rock band Deep Purple , it was their third studio album with Don Airy on Keyboards On very first listen , a lot of the album washed over me , leaving a generally positive , but honestly not too impressed or interested impression . but a genuinely good one , with literally no weak tracks .

AF74UAKV3Q3W0,B00NV7NQPK,1,1,5,"""Healing Hearts"" is the fourth solo piano release from Louis Landon in less than two years, an indication that his 2013 move to Sedona, AZ sparked an amazing creative streak for him. Since his move, Landon has established Healing Piano of Sedona which offers a unique sound healing experience to create mental, physical and emotional well-being. Landon is a Steinway Artist who has toured internationally and has released seventeen albums, eleven of which are solo piano (one is a best of). He has been using the techniques of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky for spiritual development since 1980. Healing Piano of Sedona was created to help people live life joyously, passionately, stress- and disease-free.

The thirteen tracks on ""Healing Hearts"" were created spontaneously to assist individuals in their emotional and spiritual well-being. I have to admit that in the past, I have had a strong preference for Landons more composed music, but he is improvising and performing so much now that his spontaneous music is incredibly cohesive and complete and the emotional content is rich and sincere. Landon has performed house concerts in my series every year for the past seven years and while his music has always been exceptionally good, now its often breathtaking in its beauty and honesty. Nothing is held back, coming from the purest source of creativity. Im blown away by the music on ""Healing Hearts"" and am certain that it will be the second of Landons albums on my Favorites list for 2014.

Most of the tracks overflow with peace and serenity. In fact, Louis calls his home studio The Peace Palace and I can see why! A couple of pieces are a bit livelier, but the entire album is perfect for a warm and soothing background. However, be sure to treat your mind and soul to a blissful hour of calming music that can effortlessly heal the spirit and wash away the cares of the moment, the day, or life in general - at least for a while.

All of the tracks are exceptional, but Ill mention a few favorites. Amys Song is a breath of fresh air - graceful, tender and very warm. Gorgeous! Desert Peace is somewhat more ambient and so peaceful. I love the title track, which is more minor and a bit darker, but so poignant and compelling. Now or Never seems to be offering support and encouragement to move forward - gently but firmly. Sacred is almost hymn-like. The Great Unknown is dedicated to a young family member who passed away recently. Dark and sometimes painfully sad, there is hope as the healing process takes place - an amazing piece of music! The Painter expresses the passionate spirit that can flow from one artist to another. Unstoppable begins quietly and simply, gradually building energy, strength and power. Unstoppable, indeed! A great, upbeat ending to a fantastic album!

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B004BDCGPE,1,1,5,"Alan Jackson will ultimately go down in country music history primarily for the music he made for Arista records, although we hope that he still has some great music to come, whichever label he signs for. The singles from his last Arista album of original recordings, the excellent Freight train, didn't do as well as those from his earlier albums. Initially, I wondered if American country radio stations were losing interest, but maybe Arista were switching their focus to younger artists. This compilation therefore becomes the last official compilation of Alan's Arista music. No doubt there will others in the years to come, but they will just recycle the material already released, together with whatever unreleased material lies in the Arista vaults.

The title implies that 34 of these 37 tracks were number one hits, but they weren't all number one of the American Billboard country charts. Most of the others came close, so maybe they were number ones on some other chart such as Cashbox (I don`t have access to Cashbox charts, so cannot check). Here in the real world (the title track of his first Arista album), didn't make number one on Billboard but was number one on the Canadian country chart, but all of Alan's other Canadian number ones were also number one on Billboard. Still, whether the title is accurate or not, it is fair to say that every track here is excellent.

As others have pointed out, some of Alan's hits that didn't make this compilation are also of a high quality. It would have been easy for Arista to compile a triple CD, but they probably struck the right balance in limiting this compilation to a double CD. Still, the absence of tracks such as Murder on Music Row (with George Strait), When somebody loves you (a top five country hit), I'll go on loving you (a top three country hit), Mercury blues (a number two country hit), Everything I love, Pop a top and others shows that Alan had plenty of great hits besides what you'll find here.

The three tracks not claimed as number ones ironically include one track that made it to number one on Billboard - As she's walking away, in which Alan joins the Zac Brown band. Ring of fire, a mellow cover of the old Johnny Cash classic, was a minor country hit when released as a single. The other new track, Look at me, may or may not have been released as a single, but it's a fine song.

Whether or not there are 35 number one hits here doesn't matter; Alan had almost 50 top ten hits on the Billboard country charts, every one a gem, and some of those that didn't make the top ten (especially Murder on Music Row) are also regarded by many fans as classics. This collection provides a fitting tribute to Alan's 21 years of great music with Arista, whether this is your first Alan Jackson album or whether (like me) you have most of the tracks already.","although we hope that he still has some great music to come , whichever label he signs for .

AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B00QLVXG94,1,1,4,"Brandi Carlile blends a mix of new and old in The Firewatchers Daughter.  New  the album contains a collection of 12 eclectic songs that completely show Carlile and Phil and Tim Hanseroths unadultered musicianship and production that listeners have come accustomed to hear.  And for this album, it sounds like the band did a good job to capture the intimacy of playing together.

The Firewatchers Daughter was produced on the ATCO Records label, a departure from the bands four previous albums, which were carried on the Columbia Records.  In spite of that noticeable change, the music speaks for itself.  In a world of music that possess somewhat overproduced songs, the band remains True to their roots and this album clearly shows the raw and powerful instrumentation and unique vocal style of all three members of the band, guitar, bass, vocals, hand claps, and percussions.  As one listens to each song, Carlile and company may have picked up where they left on Give Up the Ghost with the track Dying Day.  A few of the songs have that style of Americana and more.  From the opening track Wherever is Your Heart, to the proceeding ones, the extremely most rock-driven and kick the dirt type of song on the record Mainstream Kid, two rockers the cowbell makes an appearance on Blood Muscle Skin Bone and Alibi hearken to sixties-garage pop that may have showed up on the Nuggets collection.  Aside those elements of the album, there are the touching and heartfelt songs that play with immense maturity than previously heard on her first two studio albums.

Call it progressive bluegrass or acoustic Americana, Dierks Bentley has indeed taken a chance with this new disc ""Up on the Ridge.""  Though he has built up a cachet of hits including 7 number i hits and 3 number 1 albums, few with his stature would take such a risky excursion by recording an album worth of bluegrass/acoustic  entries.  Patty Loveless, Lorrie Morgan and Alan Jackson had taken such detours before in recording such side projects, but they were fraught with commercial disappointment at the chagrin of the money-hungry record executives.  Considering the fact that lead single and title track ""Up on the Ridge"" has already made headlines in the top 40 region of the country charts, looks like Bentley will be the exception to the rule.  This time round, Bentley has ditched long time friend and co-producer Brett Beavers in favour of former recording artist and songwriter Jon Randall Stewart to warm the co-producer chair.  And if you are a fan of old time bluegrass and wouldn't mind a contemporary slant, this disc is choked full of great tunes.  With Bentley co-writing only 5 cuts with new tunes coming from Nashville's top scribes including Shawn Camp, Paul Kennerley, John Scott Sherrill, Verlon Thompson and Suzi Ragsdale.  And up the bar on the standard of the songs, he has audaciously turned Bob Dylan's ""Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)"" and U2's ""Pride"" into bluegrass covers.

Of note also is the line up of artists that are brought in for some grab of credibility and star power.  As if to win him some brownie points with bluegrass purists, Chris Tile and the Punch Brothers join Bentley on a sped up version of Dylan's ""Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)"" where Bentley goes around searching for his missing girl.  The search doesn't sound that lonesome with Chris Tile's smooth Vince Gill-like tenor that goes so well with Bentley's more rugged vocals.  Miranda Lambert adds rawness to ""Bad Angel"" -a quasi-Gospel romp about a man shrugging off vices at the ""crossroads of Salvation and Temptation Streets.""  While Jamey Johnson with his world-weary gruffness brings a realistic feel to the man's battle with the bottle.  Kris Kristofferson, on the other hand, sounds worn out and short of breadth on ""Bottle to the Bottom"" that becomes distracting.  While the Alison Krauss' echoey vocals sounds like she was singing in a well on the progressive bluegrass title cut ""Up on the Ridge""--a pretty non-descript song relative to the rest of the album.

Of the newer songs, Shawn Camp and Paul Kennerley's bluesy ""Fallin' for You"" is hypnotic with a robust melody made even more delightful with its banjo and fiddle licks.  ""Draw Me A Map"" finds Bentley on more romantic grounds as he croons with affection to find his way into his lady's heart.  A definite must for those who like to experience the warmer side of Bentley.  Julie and Buddy Miller, often earmarked by their eccentric Americana endeavours, have ironically submitted the most commercial viable track here.  ""Love Grows Wild"" sounds like a future hit with its catchy melody and it's endearing lyrics.  Bravura is Bentley to taper U2's ""Pride (In the Name of Love)"" chiming guitar riffs into something more rustic without sacrificing an iota of the song's spiritual and social depths.

Bentley has indeed taken a chance to go all out to record ""Up on the Ridge"" with little nod to commerciality.  He just lets his respect and love for tradition show.  And as a result, this will indeed pay off with dividends of pure pleasures to those who like their country uncluttered.  With this new disc, Bentley has made the bluegrass/acoustic ridge viable again.","Prime Cuts : Love Grows Wild , Draw Me a Map , Fallin ' for You

A2NJG2VNE0CHV1,B001NTI978,1,1,5,"Muskrat Love is one of those humorous songs that somehow unintentionally morphed into some kind of deep commentary on shallow love.  Initially composed as a whimsical tune about anthropomorphic muskrats under the name Muskrat Candlelight, it was a minor hit for America before The Captain and Tenille turned it into a huge hit in the 1970's.

Now, decades later, this song is a nostalgic reminder of a more innocent time.  The MP3 version is far clearer than any 45 record or LP album cut from the 1970's, so it's far more enjoyable, especially The Captain's electronic sounds of muskrats kissing and mating.

For a modern 21st century audience, this song probably won't catch their ear or have the same meaning. It'll come across as though it's a song from a cartoon.  But for anyone who heard this song in the 1970's and just wants a reminder of a different time in life, it's worth the download for the gentle smile and memories it will evoke.","Muskrat Love is one of those humorous songs that somehow unintentionally morphed into some kind of deep commentary on shallow love .

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B00A3CX16K,1,1,4,"A superb voice should never have a 'recession.' Keyshia Cole epitomizes this notion as she possesses an incredible voice that has shined in every capacity of which she's employed it. 2010's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Calling-All-Hearts/dp/B0042X90LQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Calling All Hearts</a>&nbsp;was not her best album, but it also was by no means bad, yielding strong cuts the likes of ""Long Way Down,"" ""Tired of Doing Me,"" and ""Take Me Away."" But 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woman-To-Woman/dp/B00A3AUMK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woman To Woman</a>&nbsp;is better and closer to her best work on debut effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Way-It-Is/dp/B00096S3PY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Way It Is</a>&nbsp;and the valedictory sophomore effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-Like-You/dp/B000VDDCHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just Like You</a>.  The parallels unveil themselves throughout the emotional, inspired Woman To Woman, which finds Cole's brand of contemporary adult R&B at its best. She gets some help from Lil Wayne, Meek Mill, Ashanti, Elijah Blake, and Robin Thicke.  That said, none of the overshadow the chanteuse.

""Enough of No Love"" was the 'big hit' that Calling All Hearts was missing (The Nicki Minaj assisted ""I Ain't Thru"" wasn't quite it). Well produced by Harmony and laden with string patches and all the amenities of adult contemporary R&B, Cole sounds emotionally connected and tuned in. She talks a bit of trash, but doesn't overdo it as so many artists do today for shock value. By the chorus, she's on fire: ""Cause I-I can't stay here/if there's no love/yeah I-I can't stay here/cause I've had enough/enough of no love..."" Lil Wayne delivers a solid enough verse, reigning himself in and never overshadowing Cole. Excellent start by all means.

""Zero,"" featuring Meek Mill, is a turn at modern R&B with some minimalist aspects. It seems a bit restrained upon a first listen, but easily grows on you as one of the better cuts (not that any are bad) on Woman To Woman.  ""You see it pays to tell the truth, look at what you had to lose,"" Cole sings on the chorus ""...should think before you do, did you not know the rules?"" Meek Mill assists on the third verse; ""I lie just to protect you, never to disrespect you/cause what we have was so 38 special..."" 2/2 as of yet.

""Missing You"" gives Cole a solid, traditional R&B cut intact with fat, lazy bass line, contrasting the more modern tactics of ""Zero."" Guitar-patch intact from The Way It Is's ""Love,"" Cole delivers with exemplary class on this Eric Hudson produced cut.

""Trust And Believe"" is Cole's ""I'm Going Down"" or ""Saving All My Love."" It doesn't reach the classicism of either of the two cuts, but that is the parallel on this big ballad propelled by the tenets of classic soul and propelled by alt-R&B sensibilities.  Filled with many lyrical highlights, one incredibly memorable line is when Cole proclaims ""She's a 3, and I'm a 10..."" The chorus is where 'the money is': ""Trust and Believe me, you're gonna need me/trust and believe me, she'll never be me/and I'm so over you, go get lost/boy I don't know who do you think that you are?"" Cole puts some 'stank' on the closing note (you just have to hear it).

If ""Trust And Believe"" wasn't enough of a hit, ""Get It Right"" 'gets it done' with old-school dusty drum programming and excellent adult contemporary R&B production by Mel and Mus. The vocal treatment at the onset is celestial, foreshadowing the strength of the cut.  Cole's vocals continue to captivate throughout, never faltering.  Delivering another catchy, emotion chorus, ""Get It Right"" makes five straight hits.

""Woman 2 Woman"" features a shocking collaboration with Ashanti. Surprisingly, the collaboration works better than one pre-judges with Ashanti complimenting Cole well.  ""Woman 2 Woman"" is certainly an extension of ""Trust"" from Cole's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Different-Me/dp/B001H9N88Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Different Me</a>, a duet with Monica.  While ""Trust"" may have been more notable, ""Woman 2 Woman"" features all the right nuances and chemistry between both vocalists. Easily one of the stronger title tracks of 2012.

""Wonderland"" featuring Elijah Blake is another solid cut.  It is not preeminent as say ""Enough of No Love"" or ""Trust and Believe,"" but it is not too shabby either.  ""I Choose You"" is better, produced by Jack Splash and yielding a throwback soul sound.  Cole's upper register sounds exceptional on this cut, highlight on the chorus: ""If it ain't you, it's not worth it/no matter what I do, nothing working/baby I know love's not perfect/even if he can save the world that will never be enough/cause I choose you/I choose you/and If it ain't you, then it's just not worth it.""

On ""Stubborn,"" Rodney ""Darkchild"" Jerkins and Paul ""Hollywood Hotsauce"" Dawson give Cole more of a modern flair.  Being the talented vocalist/artist that she is, Cole pulls it off. That said, Cole seems best suited for more refined, lush contemporary R&B cuts that hearken the past as opposed to the gimmickry. ""Hey Sexy"" provides appropriate atonement, characterized by its 80's styled R&B groove.  Throughout the course of the number, the addictive catch line ""I know you're not, not gonna sing that song..."" is repeated over and over.  The chorus is equally catchy: ""Sexy (sexy) rock me (rock me) all night long/Hold me to the break of dawn/I love it when you turn me on...""

""Next Move,"" assisted by Robin Thicke's supporting vocals, loses no steam. Bink!'s production is superb, notable for the use of flute and hand percussion to create an incredibly lush opening.  Thicke simply supports Cole with harmonizing vocals, which is smart for this particular cut.  Right up Cole's alley, Cole 'kills' ""Next Move,"" a song that deals with deciding whether the male or female will make the 'next move' in the pending relationship, etc.

Closing cut ""Signature"" takes on a mix of pop and R&B sensibility proving to be quite the appropriate closing track.  Cole's vocals grow large in scope on the nuances and ad libs toward the end in particular.  ""Signature"" caps off an excellent album.

Overall, Woman To Woman finds Cole in excellent voice.  She is best when she connects with the material as she does here, particularly on soulful, heart wrenching numbers like ""Trust And Believe"" or ""I Choose You"" with its soulful stylings.  There are no misses with even the modern tinges of ""Stubborn"" ultimately not dragging Woman To Woman down, making this one of 2012's best urban offerings ultimately. It has stiff competition with the alt-R&B movement of Frank Ocean or Miguel, but along with Melanie Fiona and the best moments of Brandy's 'Two Eleven,' Cole shows that R&B is NOT dead.  4 stars; Enthusiastically recommended.","A superb voice should never have a ' recession .

A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,B00124JDW4,1,1,4,"You know, I have been listening to a lot of 1965-67 Coltrane lately, and as essential as this is to my system, I need a break.

And maybe that was part of the idea Charles Lloyd had when he put out Forest Flower in 1967. Coltrane, Shepp, Taylor, The Black Panthers, protest vs. revolution. All this had taken over jazz that year. So Charles Lloyd comes along, and Forest Flower says--""This is all supposed to be fun. Chill for a second. We'll make the demonstration tomorrow. Let's play some tunes. RELAX!""

Not that these ""tunes"" leave subtance lacking. Lloyds sense of harmony and melody is increadible. Listening to is chord structres, I feel as if a Beatles or Brian Wilson has been channeled into a jazz man. His chords are so tuneful, this music is just a joy to listen to. Fresh and clean now as it was the day it was born.

I don't have to tell you about the skill of Keith Jarret or Jack Dejonette--there is a reason Miles inducted them--and proof is right here.

There was a lot of great jazz like this during this era, and unfortunately, it gets hidden in the shadow of giants like Coltrane, Miles, and Archie Shepp. Listen to them always, but dig on this sometimes, too.","and as essential as this is to my system , I need a break .

A6D4TIANI3E6N,B0181O9DEK,1,1,4,"Saw Ted/Trucks band on ACL and liked them so WishListed ""Let Me Get By"".

First the music...

While generally classified as Blues-Rock or Blues, I hear a country-rock flavor in many tracks. Not surprising given Trucks' Allman Brothers roots, but I hear more of it in Susan's voice on some tracks. Best example is track 1, ""Anyhow"". While I'm not a ""country fan"", I'm not adverse to a little country flavor... just not into a steady diet of it. And Flavor is all that is here... and only on some tracks adding to the variety and there is nothing if not variety in this 2 disc set.

Other tracks are pure blues including some where Susan's voice is reminiscent of Bonnie Raitt. Track 2, ""Laugh About It"", is an early example. I love Bonnie, but if I heard her in every vocal, then I'd be critical. I didn't, so I'm not.

And then there are tracks that come out of nowhere... juke joint material... rock... just wonderfully varied listening.

Now onto the SQ (Sound Quality). When I saw TTB on ACL there must have been eight or ten players on stage. Guitars, horns, keyboards, string, drums x 2 and backing vocalists. And they all seem to be there on this CD, but when they all play I have issues telling and that's the rub. On the three or four busiest tracks the supporting cast all seem to fall into a mush of sound even sometimes dragging the backup vocals with them. Susan's vocals always rise above as does Derek's guitar work, but there's mired sound below them.

Simpler tracks, like the stripped down ""Swamp Raga..."", are beautifully done, as are those where backing instruments tend to take turns, making the confusion of the bogged down tracks all the more mysterious. Not a reason to avoid purchase of this issue, but potentially a reason to skip a track here and there depending on my mood.","and liked them so WishListed "" Let Me Get By "" .

A3TI1WDAEOTD0I,B00136NE62,1,1,5,"Black or White is one of those songs by Michael Jackson that is memorable not just because of the beat and the video that would later accompany it, but because of the words.

We live in a time where so much is put on color, but there is something else that I realized when I heard the song recently. Life is not black and white. Nothing is really at its best when it is separated and distilled. Michael Jackson knew that in his career and refused to be defined. We would do ourselves and the world a favor that doing the same.

Black or White contains a message that minds us that we are all human, all important regardless of what we look like. What matters is how we live and treat our fellowman. If we remember that, then we will truly be able to say we are living life to the fullest.","that is memorable not just Nothing is really at its best and refused to be defined . and the world a favor that doing the same . that we are all human , all important regardless of what we look like .

But back in the 80's, when the industry was starting to second guess Elton, he had some songs that were away from what he did best with Bernie Taupin, that showed well in some tracks like Mama Can't Buy Me Love and Blue Eyes. Blue Eyes which he wrote with Gary Osbourne is one of those forgotten gems of Elton's that definitely is a pleasure to listen to. It is a simplistic song that shows Elton's character at heart well in songs. While many people don't look or listen to it as is the case with I'm Still Standing and I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues, it still is one song absolutely worth checking out, young and old Elton John fans alike.

A2UYGOYMV73826,B00DMXITFA,1,1,4,"Garrison Keillor calls them an old-timey band, and that they are.  It's bittersweet to hear this record and know that their sound will be significantly different from now on.

My personal favorite is Big Iron World, and this CD is not up to that level.  Carry Me Back focuses more on the sizzling fiddle and less on the soaring harmonies.  However, it's a good time, and there really isn't a weak track in the bunch.

The title track, Carry Me Back to Virginia, is written from the perspective of a soldier who fought with his brother in the Civil War.  Track 3, Levi, extends the theme by portraying a country boy who fought and died in Iraq.  Although the songs deal with classic tragic themes, the music is lively and inspiring.  In fact, many of the songs here are pretty downbeat if you just focus on the lyrics, but the music lifts you up.

My favorite song is Country Gal.  It is the lightest in tone and comes out of nowhere with a snippet of Hey Good Lookin' by Hank Williams.  I love songs that you can sing along to the very first time you hear them.

The songs on this album reward continued listening.  The lyrics are strong.  These boys tell a good story, and each song is really a little party.  The exception would be the final song, Ways of Man, which is more reflective and much quieter.  It's an interesting way to end the album.

My favorite part of this band are the harmonies.  You can't really get much better than OCMS singing I Hear Them All.  The harmonies here are not as sustained or jubilant.  Still a worthy addition to their canon.  I really hope the group can evolve after the departure of Watson and Younts.  Nobody else really does music the way they do, they have created their own niche.  Mumford and Sons, Trampled by Turtles, Avett Brothers have similar characteristics, but to my mind OCMS inhabits ""old-timey"" like no one else.","It is bittersweet to hear this record My personal favorite is Big Iron World , and less on the soaring harmonies .

A1TPW86OHXTXFC,B0082JYAZ2,1,1,4,"I first noticed Regina Spektor on the Letterman show, and she blew me away.
Her music was infectious, the words so original and descriptive. Her expressions surprising and her delivery superb. And, then I listened to her interview on NPR's 'Fresh Air'and was captivated by her style and originality. I purchased her CD and listened many times.

First of all, Regina's voice is one of the most distinctive out there. She can go from musing and romantic to silly and fun, but never frivolous. Her words and their music are too serious. Regina immigrated from Russian as a small child. She and her parents lived in New York City where she was introduced to music everyday, the Beatles, classic rock, folk songs and classical music. She studied music as a small child and then moved from classical music to her now eclectic style. She is well known for her originality and her style. Many television shows use her music, and now she has become recognized. Regina Skeptor is a classic.

Her latest CD is exciting. My favorite is the song about museums and the paintings wanting to jump off the walls, 'All The Rowboats', with her distinctive vocalizations. Then 'Ballad Of A Politician', with it's superb satire, ""shaking, shaking hand; Shake It, Shake It Baby'. The other tunes fall into place and deserve a place of their own.

Regina has a constant discussion with her piano tuners about the loudness and banging that occurs. She wants a smoother, more soothing style, and, she has to let them know this is her style, this is who she is. She is a romantic unusual stylist with a voice that overcomes any singular complaint. She is superb, what more can be said?

Highly Recommended. prisrob 09-06-12

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00123IAVK,1,1,5,"History is littered with a lot of romantic talk of the bay area music scene of the late 60's. Much of it heavily based in fact. Most of this is of the psychedelic rock scene of that city. But there were some important hybrids too. For Frisco it was Santana. For Oakland it was Tower Of Power. A multi racial band coming out of the same stew as the Santana Band and Sly & The Family Stone this was a band that,especially in the beginning were very much on what you might call the very live garage band type of funk. Based heavily in what James Brown was doing at the time,they had an approch that couldn't be more different if it tried.

  Right off the bat the album kicks off with ""Knock Yourself Out"". This along with the witty ""Social Lubrication"" and ""The Price"",""Back On The Streets Again"" and ""The Skunk,The Goose And The Fly"",with almost goofy lyrical exchanges are TOP before they were even closed to slick. The rhythm section is right out in your face,the horns are blaring right out and the vocals are as raw and unrefined as you'd hear on any Kool & The Gang and James Brown album you'd find during the period. Somehow or other though,there's a mild soulful gentleness to the whole thing. Especially as a number of these songs lead out with some mildly bluesy Hendrix type rock guitar riffs.

  The real break from the funk tradition this album tends to set is the closer ""Sparkling In The Sand"". This is a very slow 9+ minute ballad that has much more of a jazz flavor with more prominant reed solos than anything else. It's surprising with the amount of funk process activity taking place on both ends of the Bay Area in 1970-with Sly Stone,Santana,War and Tower Of Power here all making extremely important contributions,that the music didn't overburden itself before it really got going. It's a testement to the enduring power and stylistic elasticity of funk that that never happened. This and all of those bands prospered greatly during the era. And laid the groundwork for what is sometimes called ""united funk"".","History is littered with a lot of romantic talk of the bay area music scene of the late 60 's .

The other 14 minutes were a jam featuring an organ solo by Doug Ingle, a guitar solo by Erik Brann and a drum solo by Ron Bushy. Bassist Lee Dorman got half a duet with Ingle, but Bushy proved with his drum solo that you can get away with repeating ""Shave and a Haircut, Six Bits"" for a long time. As long as you dress it up with enough effects pedals. He got half a duet with Ingle too--a fantasia built on (would you believe) ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"". So when Atco edited out everything but the vocal section, you got three reps each of the verse and refrain. So it didn't make much of a single.

Its the kind of song that punk rockers looked to stick a safety pin through to burst the 60s love and peace idealism. Looking back on the song with the space of almost a half-century, it is over indulgant, about 10 minutes too long, but that propulsive beat will still cause you to knod your head in rhythm.

A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B00137QTS6,1,1,5,"No doubt about it. When Motown pulled up stakes and moved the bulk of its operations to the West Coast in the early 1970's the center of gravity in the world of soul music shifted dramatically. But it did not, as the executives at Motown had hoped, follow them to Los Angeles. Rather, the new capitol of soul music was located about 450 miles to the south and east of Detroit in the City of Brotherly Love. For it was just about that same time that producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff in conjunction with CBS founded Philadelphia International Records. It would go on to become the dominant soul label for the next decade featuring artists like Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes, Billy Paul, The Three Degrees and so many others. But clearly the most important and successful group to record for Philadelphia International was The O'Jays.

Now before signing with Philadelphia International in 1972 The O'Jays had been around the block a time or two. The group was formed in 1961 and was originally known as The Triumphs. The group was renamed by Cleveland disc jockey Eddie O'Jay.  During the 1960's The O'Jays amassed a total of 10 charted singles but none made a huge splash on the Billboard Hot 100.  That would all change in July 1972 with the release of ""Backstabbers"" which would peak at #3.  It quickly became apparent that Gamble & Huff knew how to best utilize the talents of this venerable group and several more hits would follow over the next few years.","No doubt about it .

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.","that said , I could explain all the reasons I love this , that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool , It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides Granted it is only a 30 second sample , but that is generally enough time to explore new bands that is generally enough time to explore new bands or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version .

A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B00D2I8E3C,1,1,5,"Sly and the Family Stone's catalog has never been difficult to find. In addition to dozens of compilations (one of which, 1970's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Greatest-Hits/dp/B000GG4XI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Greatest Hits</a>, was their first album to top the charts), the band's original albums have been remastered and reissued with expanded track listings. The remastered albums have themselves also been anthologized as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Collection/dp/B000N69PD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Collection</a>. But there's more to Sylvester Stewart than the Family Stone and there's more to the Family Stone's catalog than the albums. Pulling together pre-Family obscurities, hit singles (many in their punchy mono single mixes), album cuts, live performances and previously unissued material creates an arc of musical discovery that paints a wholly (or holy) different picture than hearing the material in separate installments.

This box set opens with five sides Stewart (not yet Stone) recorded for San Francisco's Autumn label in 1964 and 1965. Stewart served as a staff producer for Autumn, helming sessions for the Beau Brummels, Mojo Men, Great Society and others (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Precious-Stone/dp/B0000009IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Precious Stone</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Listen-to-the-Voices/dp/B0037M5X1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Listen to the Voices</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Autumn-Records-Story/dp/B0000074U1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Autumn Records Story</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-With-Me/dp/B0000004EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance With Me</a>&nbsp;for more of his production work), and his first sides riff on the hit single, ""C'mon and Swim,"" he'd written and produced for Bobby Freeman. The B-side, ""Scat Swim,"" cut a deeper groove than the plug side, and his next single, ""Buttermilk (Part 1),"" was a catchy blue-soul instrumental, with Stewart playing all the instruments, including organ and harmonica leads. The unreleased ""Dance All Night"" and his last single for Autumn, ""Temptation Walk,"" show how early (and easily) Stewart began mixing pop, soul, blues, R&B and jazz into his original stew.

After leaving Autumn, Stewart quickly assembled what was to become Sly and the Family Stone, and waxed the 1967 demos that would land them a contract with Epic. In the wake of the group's later success, two of the tracks, the original ""I Ain't Got Nobody (For Real)"" and a cover of Otis Redding's ""I Can't Turn You Lose,"" were released on the Loadstone label. The former is powered by Larry Graham's insistent bass line and topped by the Family Stone's trademark trumpet-sax combination of Cynthia Robinson and Jerry Martini. The group began recording for Epic (at the same Golden State Recorders at which Stewart had produced for Autumn Records) in mid-1967, and the fruits of these initial sessions fill out disc one, starting with their first A-side, ""Underdog,"" and its two B-sides, ""Higher"" (from early promo singles) and ""Bad Risk.""

Despite a fresh sound that crackled with the energy of its multiple roots, neither the single nor the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Whole-New-Thing/dp/B005F9TQ38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Whole New Thing</a>&nbsp;made a commercial impression at the time; it wasn't until ""Dance to the Music"" was recorded in September that the Family Stone had their first hit in the can. Launched in January 1968, ""Dance to the Music"" quickly established the group's revolutionary combination of pop, rock, soul, funk and gospel, and shifted the course of pop music. Other acts quickly latched onto elements of the sound, but none could match Stewart's output as a songwriter or the band's approach as a unit. The group was sufficiently prolific as to leave fully-finished masters in the vault, including the four that end disc one. Here you'll find the band trying out previously unheard original songs, experimental vocal arrangements, and repurposed lyrics and melodies.

The July-August 1967 session tracks continue on disc two, showing the wealth of great material produced before the band finally hit with ""Dance to the Music."" Two of session tracks (""What Would I Do"" and ""Only One Way Out of This Mess"") were previously issued on the expanded edition of A Whole New Thing, but three more are included here for the first time: an inventive cover of the pop-folk song ""What's it Got to Do With Me,"" an early take on the autobiographical ""Future and Fame"" and the Freddie Stone-sung deep soul ballad ""I Know What You Came to Say."" All five session tracks are as good as the material that made the original album, but the lack of early commercial success doomed this extra material to a long stay in the vault.

The band's commercial breakthrough is finally heard six tracks into disc two, with the ecstatic three-minute mono single mix of ""Dance to the Music."" The song is, quite literally, a brilliantly catchy tutorial on the sound being created before the listener's very ears. As memorable as are the mono singles, stereo album sides like ""Ride the Rhythm"" more expansively show off the band's inventive arrangements and tight musicianship as they explode across the soundstage. Disc two finishes out with album tracks from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-to-the-Music/dp/B00136RZLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance to the Music</a>, the previously unreleased ""We Love All,"" the obscure mostly-instrumental French-language single ""Danse a la Musique"" (and it's even stranger Chipmunk-voiced B-side, ""Small Fries""), the unreleased B-side ""Chicken,"" and exuberant sides from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life/dp/B005F9TQ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life</a>, including mono single masters for ""Life"" (with a different lead vocal track than the album cut) and ""M'Lady.""

Disc three opens with the band's second smash single, the #1 ""Everyday People"" and its charting flipside, ""Sing a Simple Song."" These tracks, along with ""Stand!"" (offered here in a live recording) and ""I Want to Take You Higher,"" powered the commercial success of the band's third album. As with their debut, the band recorded a lot more material during the album sessions than they could issue, and disc three includes another helping of previously unreleased bonuses, including unused instrumental backings. The group became a hot live act, essayed here with performances from the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, and scored in 1969 as singles artists with ""Hot Fun in the Summertime,"" ""Everybody is a Star"" and ""Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),"" all heard here as mono singles.

The final disc open with the band's next album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/There-s-a-Riot-Goin-On/dp/B0013384JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">There's a Riot Goin' On</a>, including album tracks and all three of its singles. Ironically, though the album yielded the hit ""Family Affair,"" it was recorded in large part by Stone alone, with overdubs by Family members and other hired-hands (including keyboard player Billy Preston). The album hasn't the organic sound or joyous mood of the band's earlier material, and the sonics of 1971 overdubbing and the use of a drum machine on several tracks subdues the group's underlying funk. By 1973 the group's membership was beginning to change, including new drummers, a replacement for the departed Larry Graham, and the addition of a third horn player. The group's singles (including ""If You Want Me to Stay"" and ""Time for Livin'"") continued to chart in the Top 40, as did their final two albums Fresh and Small Talk.

By 1975 Sly had disbanded the Family Stone and begun to record as a solo artist backed by hired musicians. His album High on You, expands beyond the musical boundaries of the Family Stone, adding steel guitar and other touches that hadn't been heard on the band's releases. Disc four closes out with selections from Stone's solo work, from the then-newly formulated Family Stone's Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I'm Back, and a pair of previously unreleased tracks, ""Hoboken"" and ""High."" The box set lingers a bit more over the first-half of the group's career, rushing through the latter half in a single disc, but that's in balance with the band's rise to fame, the peaking of their invention, and the view most listeners will have of their career.

This is a well thought out anthology, touching on Stewart's pre-Family solo work, the Family's rise to fame, their chart domination and fire as a live act, their eventual end and Sly Stone's return to solo work. Along the way there are iconic hit singles, B-sides and album tracks, seventeen previously unreleased tracks and a large helping of original mono single mixes. The only real omission from this set are the studio versions of ""Stand"" and ""I Want to Take You Higher!,"" each of which are included among the live tracks. The mono mixes will be greatly appreciated by fans who have already completed their collection of the expanded stereo album reissues. For those without any of the group's catalog on-hand, your surround sound-trained ears may find the stereo hits more immediately satisfying; check out the album reissues, or the anthologies Greatest Hits or Essential.

In addition to the mono mixes and unreleased tracks, the set's 104-page book is its own star. The book includes finely written liner notes, an informative timeline, rare photographs, reproductions of labels, sleeves and posters, and revelatory track-by-track comments from the Greg Errico, Larry Graham,  Jerry Martini, Cynthia Robinson, Sly Stone and many others. In addition to the standard 4-CD set, there are several variations: an Amazon exclusive CD box that adds a fifth disc (and parallel MP3 downloads), a vinyl LP edition (with its own Amazon exclusive variation) and a single disc highlights.

A18IZ5QX2PRB3C,B00FY3LLKG,1,1,4,"Armed with a contract from the fledgling Arista record label and building on the success of the stripped back ""Winter in America"", Gil Scott-Heron and musical partner Brian Jackson entered the studio to record ""The First Minute of the New Day"".  Whereas ""Winter in America"" was largely just Scott-Heron and Jackson, ""The First Minute of the New Day"" is fully arranged music sitting close to a vocal jazz style, but with a healthy dose of funk overtones.  The sound on this record is distinctive and quite unlike much of Scott-Heron's other work-- in part because of the presence of additional vocalist Victor Brown.  Brown's high tenor provides a fantastic offset to Scott-Heron's lower register, and the two harmonize to great effect.  The band supporting them is essentially a sax quartet (Bilal Sunni Ali on reeds, Jackson on piano, Danny Bowens on electric bass and Bob Adams on drums) augmented by a trio of percussionists-- Charlie Saunders, Eddie Knowles and Barnett Williams.  The band whips up a blues/jazz/funk stew, anchored effectively by Bowens, who proves stunningly agile and effective, weaving in and out of the delicate wall of percussion and the melodies.

The pieces themselves on the album are staggering in their diversity, from a mournful blues (""Winter in America"") to a delicate and serene jazz ballad (""Offering"") to deep funk (""The Liberation Song"") and spoken word (""Pardon Our Analysis"").  As expected, Scott-Heron's lyrical wit is in full effect, whether discussing the politics of Africa, the Nixon administration, the state of the nation or just reflections on everyday life, he's nothing short of brilliant.

This reissue augments the album with a pair of bonus tracks- an extended spoken word piece including a reprise of Scott-Heron's famed ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised"" (and one of the most brilliant performances on record by him in spoken word) and a solo performance of ""Winter in America"" from the late '70s.  All of this is remastered and sounds superb.

It's not quite the masterpiece that it's predecessor (""Winter in America"") or its successor (""From South Africa to South Carolina"") is, but ""The First Minute of a New Day"" is a fantastic album, capturing an artist at his peak.  Highly recommended.","and building on the success of the stripped back "" Winter in America "" , Gil Scott - Heron Whereas "" Winter in America "" was largely just Scott - Heron but with a healthy dose of funk overtones .

A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B013YXXU9M,1,1,5,"The original Volume 1 of It's Too Late to Stop Now was first released in 1974 and showcases the best moments distilled from three live performances on Van's 1973 world tour: at The Troubadour in LA, the Santa Monica Civic and the great and much-missed Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London (which, alas, is no more). Many make a convincing case that this is the greatest live-performance album of all time, by any artist.

Van has always been a multi-talented writer, producer and arranger and this tour featured his Caledonia Soul Orchestra with string and brass sections complementing the rock music instrumental backing line-up to highlight every mood change during the gig: brass for the full-on rock/soul numbers, strings to fill out the more atmospheric pieces, and the whole held together by Van's unique, powerful and insistent vocal. The result by any logic shouldn't even work, but Van's extraordinary genius for synthesising different styles into his own trademark sound makes for a one-off, an all-time great. Even if you're not a committed Van Morrison fan, listen and you'll understand why he inspires such respect and has such a loyal fan base. From the explosive opener When you got a heartache youll just be overtaken by the irresistible urge to jump to your feet and dance  even if you're driving, which can be a problem!

I saw this line-up live at the very first Knebworth One-Day Festival on a hot summer Saturday in 1974 (I was very young and it was my first ever outdoor concert), and have never forgotten Van belting out those powerful, soulful vocals into the summer afternoon sunshine backed by a band so tight, so seamlessly unified yet infinitely flexible and responsive they were one beautiful organic whole, to treat the listener to a truly awesome, unforgettable experience. Since that day, I have been a die-hard Van Morrison fan.

The 18 numbers performed on this album are the best of the best, performed by one of the world's great musical artists in his prime, still with the power and restlessness of youth in his soul but with enough experience and maturity to understand the complexities of sound and instrumentation mix and the discipline necessary to pull it together and make it work. The power of Van's vocal delivery and his ability for on-the-spot improvisation to go with the mood of the moment often belie the committed professionalism of execution, the attention to minor details behind the performance. It's masterful.

This album is a True classic. It's outstanding; it has soul. Whichever of the various releases over the years you listen to (it doesn't really matter), just listen to it. Then buy the 2016-released package containing volumes 2, 3 & 4.","The original Volume 1 of It is Too Late to Stop Now was first released in 1974 and showcases the best moments distilled from three live performances on Van 's 1973 world tour : at The Troubadour in LA , the Santa Monica Civic and the great and much - missed Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park , London ( which , alas , is no more ) .

""D'ove L'amore"" was also a single, and the remixes were quite nice. Actually, all the remixes for the singles during this era were exceptionally well done. I never cared much for ""The Power"", that's one I usually skip over, but the rest of the album is great. We have a new remix version of ""We All Sleep Alone"", which has always been one of my favorite Cher songs. ""Takin Back My Heart"" has a similar theme that ""Strong Enough"" does, and ""Runaway"" has a similar sentiment too. All great songs though.

To enjoy this album you're really going to have to like their harmonies as applied to the standard operating procedure of MOR albums of the day: an album would have a single or two (or none) padded with covers of standards or show tunes or other popular hits of the day.

Of the twelve songs, one is the hit single title track, three are penned by John Stewart of the Kingston Trio (soon to have a #1 song with the Monkees singing his ""Daydream Believer""), and the rest are a random assortment of show tunes. I picked up this album as well as the second,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Make-Someone-Happy/dp/B00386OKYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Make Someone Happy</a>, from the used bins a few years ago. We Five's sound is pleasing to the ear but the MOR playlist lends a generic touch to their legacy; this playlist could have come from the Sandpipers but We Five turned up for the recording session instead.

Unless you're seriously jonesing to relive memories of this album echoing through the hallways of the college dorm, you're probably better off downloading the one hit, sampling the others and seeing which might round out your We Five selections.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B01DKYRCEY,1,1,4,"This past year so far, 2016 we've have lost a lot of legends that really did know the strength of making great music with the losses of David Bowie and Prince. But also, we've seen a few legends really come back into the music industry after leaving the industry for personal matters. With Phil Collins coming back after retiring and re-releasing his catalog, many fans have really rediscovered his brilliance and talent as a musician, and a noble solo songwriter. But that has also been said to with the great Paul McCartney in his own legacy, with him re-releasing his solo collection of songs and what he did with Wings and other projects on his own, the legendary Beatle has really shown a lot of joy with people revisiting his solo work. But unfortunately, it is also a year of deviating sadness for Paul, with the heartbreaking death of legendary Beatles producer Sir George Martin, whom guided him with the fab four, and his solo efforts abroad. Paul has had some sadness, but with him releasing a career-spanning box set of his works, after The Beatles, and a new tour on the horizon for Sir Paul's brilliance, his solo work in tact just as strong as The Beatles and even broader alive and well. But for his work, the question is, Is Paul McCartney still relevant and strong? Yes he is.

Pure McCartney is a career-spanning collection of Paul McCartney's solo hits. There are two collections of this album, deluxe and regular, but this will focus on the 4 disc deluxe collection. The collection of his solo works is a strong ans distinctive reflection of McCartney's work with Wings and and his solo work that does display how brilliant Paul's gifts in song have been strong and show a nobly deep reflection of his great solo career, over 45 years of the making strong. The songs have all been remastered well, and show a lot of Paul's genius well from classic tracks like Maybe I'm Amazed, Let 'Em In with Wings, as well as newer hits for Paul that have been not as strongly recognized like New, No More Lonely Nights, Dance Tonight from Memory Almost Full and Sing The Changes from 2008's work The Fireman. The collection does highlight Paul's own work well, but the collection does have a few setbacks in play. First, Pure McCartney does overlook a few of Paul's biggest hits from his career and standout songs that Paul are richly distinctive like The Girl Is Mine with Michael Jackson, Ever Present Past, the theme song Paul did for the movie Spies Like Us, Freedom which Paul composed from Driving Rain in regards to the tragedy of the 9/11 attacks and a few other classics. Not only that, but second, the collection is not in chronological order, where it can be more confusing for new Paul McCartney fans, that are just getting into his music for the first time, not though for die hard fans of Paul's greatness.

Despite a few flaws, Pure McCartney is a very good buy for both die hard Paul McCartney fans, as well as newcomers that have never heard a song Paul McCartney had ever done before. this collection shows that Paul's legacy is still alive and well, and just as richly, widely celebrated as well as his work with The Beatles. It has been a legacy worth celebrating in every way from one of the world's distinctive and curious songwriters that is worth its money. I have always loved why Paul McCartney's classics are just as strong today, as they were back then in the 70's, 80's, and 90's, etc. I absolutely recommend this compilation a lot. We'll still say Maybe I'm Amazed, well we're amazed well with this album.

Matthew 14: 25 - 31 provides a lyrical backdrop: Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the [Sea of Galilee]. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. Its a ghost, they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: Take courage! It is I. Dont be afraid. Lord, if its you, Peter replied, tell me to come to you on the water.
Come, he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, Lord, save me! Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. You of little faith, he said, why did you doubt? (NIV). It is this fear of the unkown - the deep, dark waters - that terrrified Peter, and it is this fear of the unknown that we confront as we face our own mortality.

A2J6ETTZJTMN1U,B0070LQJ7U,1,1,5,"Yes is one of those bands that I love no matter which lineup is currently working.  That being said, I jumped aboard the YesWorld bandwagon with the album ""Drama.""  I didn't know that much about them then, so didn't care who was ""supposed"" to be singing or playing keyboards.  Therefore, I judged that album at face value and believed it to be one of best prog-rock albums of all time.  I believe that still.

Needless to say, I was very excited to hear that ""Fly From Here"" boasts the same basic lineup as on ""Drama,"" with the exception of Horn singing...sort of...Trevor Horn adds backing vocals, which makes the sound complete to my ears.  ""Fly From Here"" is not nearly as dramatic (for lack of a better word) as ""Drama"" but the sound is there and it is still very magical.  To me, it is the ""middle-aged"" version of ""Drama"" so it makes sense to me that it is more mellow than it's predecessor.

Bottom line?  The songs on ""Fly From Here"" are beautiful.  In fact, I believe this to be the most listenable Yes album in their catalog.  (Check out ""Hour Of Need""!!!)

AF65C8QK9NNXP,B00UFZYX08,1,1,4,"English rockers Muse return with their new album Drones and it's another good collection of progressive pop music with those signature vocals that call out for awareness of everything around you. Produced by musical legend Robert ""Mutt"" Lange, Drones sounds stunning with awesome instrument sounds and effects in addition to crystal clear mixing and mastering. This time Muse have gone for a concept album revolving around the loss of human feelings in the modern world. Highlights include the awesome electronic infused opening track ""Dead Inside"", the bombastic shuffle groove of ""Psycho"", the killer guitar riffs and effect filled chorus of ""Reapers"" which also has a mad guitar solo, the big half time groove and huge production of ""The Handler"", the massively Queen influenced call to revolt of ""Defector"", and the emotional vocal delivery of the cinematic ballad ""Aftermath"" which builds to a warm crescendo. Despite the fact that Muse have played it a little safe by adhering closely to the style they're known for, Drones is a good modern rock album that will satisfy fans of this band and certainly lead to another entertaining live concert from this stylish three piece.","English rockers Muse return with their new album Drones and it is another good collection of progressive pop music with those signature vocals Produced by musical legend Robert "" Mutt "" Lange , Drones sounds stunning with awesome instrument sounds and effects in addition to crystal clear mixing This time Muse have gone for a concept album revolving around the loss of human feelings in the modern world .

AF74UAKV3Q3W0,B00VNAU3CG,1,1,5,"""Fire in the Rainstorm"" is Kori Linae Carothers second project with Will Ackerman producing, and her first solo piano album. It is her fourth album to date and contains twelve original pieces. With one of the more dramatic album covers of the year, the music is both eloquent and beautiful, fueled by grace and passionate emotion. I thoroughly enjoyed Koris first recording with Ackerman, ""Trillium,"" but it is amazing the depth and honesty that is often revealed when an artist goes it alone with just the piano. Such is the case here. It is interesting to note from her bio, that Kori is deaf in one ear and was told as a child that she would never be a musician. She continued her music studies through high school and college, proving the naysayers to be completely wrong. In a way, she has come full circle and is now donating a percentage of the sales from ""Fire in the Rainstorm"" to Hearing Health Foundation.

The album opens with A Day Like No Other, a dreamy and slightly melancholy piece that also expresses determination and hope - a lovely way to begin. Flowing and lyrical, it grabbed my attention right away! Nunus Sunrise was composed as a loving tribute with warmth and strong emotions. Its really interesting how the piece starts to slow near the end and then just fades out, unresolved - kind of like life does sometimes. Meadow is a favorite with its relaxed, carefree mood and easy grace. Tidal Rift is a beautiful, heartfelt piece inspired by the ups and downs in relationships - another favorite. The title track is a passionate piece written for a friend whose life has been full of turbulence. The piece begins calmly, gradually building in intensity and drama - very powerful! The Day is a tribute to those who lost their lives on 9/11. Originally recorded as an electronic piece on Koris first album, ""The Road Less Traveled,"" its a poignant and tender piano solo - another favorite. The Kindly Beast is especially touching, knowing that Marvin, Koris beloved dog, died recently. He followed her everywhere and liked to get in the way of her hands when she was playing the piano (Ive had the same problem with my cats!). Marvins playful antics will live forever in this song. Whispers of the Heart is a stirring tribute to friends and family who stand by through lifes trials and joys. Buoyant yet deeply emotional, its a beauty! When the Trees Fell mourns the loss of a giant tree with five trunks that was taken down by a huge storm. Grief and loss flow throughout this gorgeous piece, ending the album with a sigh and a tear.

McKennitt is known mostly for her Celtic - New Age and folk but also playing the harp, piano and other instruments.  The music for this song, however, is enhanced by her range of vocalization, which (in my opinion) is awesome! Several years ago, our Irish step dancing group performed a dance to this song as a tribute for a great man and friend that passed suddenly.  Not only is this song about passing, but, the ultimate resurrection that follows. My daughter first introduced me to the songs of Ms. McKennitt & I will always remember the meaningful message this song offers.  Definitely will purchase additional songs buy this talented young woman.","Wonderful & timeless , the message Loreena conveys is one but also playing the harp , piano however , is enhanced by her range of vocalization , which ( in my opinion ) is awesome !

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00YVWDWDK,1,1,5,"""See You in September"" is an excellent song by Sid Wayne and Sherman Edwards. It was first recorded by The Tempos in 1959 but I think this rendition by The Happenings is superior. The Happenings perform this with much more energy than The Tempos ever did and just one listen tells you their hearts were truly in it! Indeed, ""See You in September"" was a major number 1 breakout hit for The Happenings in 1966, so much so that their version even reached R.I.A.A. gold disc status!

The original members of The Happenings performing here include Bob Miranda, David Libert, Tom Giuliano and Ralph DiVito; and they do a superb job on ""See You in September."" These guys never miss a note and they make this a most passionate ballad. The music fits in perfectly with the vocals and the band makes this catchy and memorable at once. It brings back good memories, too.

Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers that has really been more of a product, than a actual songstress of the heart. It is just so sad, because the more stunts she has pulled, or the more she is severely overplayed like Michael Jackson was, the more her songs are not worth listening to anymore. It is sad. Flawless has been one of those songs to where she is trying ti be more street than really rap alone, and tragically she has not been able to deliver around the voice alone. I personally found this song to be just as wasted as when she tried to deliver on rap with songs like Video Phone and Diva from her I Am... Sasha Fierce. Overall, if you are a die hard fan or new to Beyonce' Knowles music, I would suggest you pass this song up, and go to her songs when she was a part of Destiny's Child, or play Crazy In Love to death.

A1NS9WO1VACAUN,B00NO2TTQ2,1,1,5,"2014 has been a creative year for Mary J Blige.  Just to be clear, Ive been a casual Mary fan since ""You Remind Me"" premiered on BET 22 years ago.  I loved her first three albums and then I veered away from her as she started delving into more adult R&B.  I came back when ""Growing Pains"" was released and enjoyed that album fully and then again really didn't get into her releases afterwards as much.
Earlier this year, I heard the ""Think Like A Man"" soundtrack and just about loved every track that Mary did....think fresher newer R&B along with discoey r&b.  If you haven't heard it, then please check that album out.  The promotion for that album sucked and the singles chosen made no sense.
Now for the London Sessions, Mary's worked with some serious british hit-makers to put out her most ground-breaking work to date all while staying True to that core Mary sound.  The ballads are all up there with ""Not Gon' Cry"" ""Sweet Thing"" yet sound crisp and fresh and emotional and I just really cant stop listening to them.  Not loving you, Doubt and Whole damn year are my absolute faves from the ballad side.  Then we have the house side which reminds me of 90's sounds from Nightcrawlers, Robin S, etc.  My absolute favorite track on the album is the stunning house epic, ""My Loving."" The delivery is stunning, the emotion, the beat, the tweaked background vocals, all stunning.

Please don't mess up the promo for this album.  While i love ""Therapy,""  did not agree that it should be the song she should have performed at the AMA's.  Mary - perform ""My Loving"" ""Doubt"" ""Whole Damn Year"" or ""Not Loving You"" at the next awards show.  Those tracks need to be heard by the masses.","2014 has been a creative year for Mary J Blige .

She had been absent from making music for quite a long time, not just on her own, but also with No Doubt. Last year, the group returned after nearly a decade from making catchy songs. They didn't hit the nail on the head they had wanted with Settle Down. The song was good, but not as strong as what they had before. Baby Don't Lie, Gwen's latest solo song isn't, bad honestly not overwhelming. The song is catchy, but not as good as her earlier songs from her career Sweet Escape, Rich Girl, Hollaback Girl and others to name a few. Still, it is a decent song, and definitely much better than the songs than Katy Perry had came out with, trying to deliver the same striking vibe that Gwen had shown. Hopefully, Gwen can come out with other song a bit better than this one was. This one doesn't lie, but could use a bit more to the heart.

A2A6S9FGQIX5JK,B009AQOZIS,1,-1,3,"First off, I agree with the most common complaints here, that 1) the production is rather weak, and 2) the singer is pretty poor. But even given that, this is a decent collection of songs that, to my ears, mostly pay tribute to Harris' roots in Uriah Heep/UFO British hard rock of the early/mid 1970s. To be fair, I wouldn't have given this more than one listen if it weren't Steve Harris, but since it is him, and I did, I would say if you are a Maiden or Harris fan, and go in with realistic expectations, you'll find a decent album with some good hard rock songs on it. It's NOT great, and hopefully if Harris continues to do music outside of Maiden he'll go in different direction next time. It's basically a tribute to his earliest influences. Take that for what it's worth!","First off , I agree with the most common complaints here , that 1 ) the production is rather weak , and 2 ) the singer is pretty poor . that , this is a decent collection of songs that , to my ears , mostly pay tribute to Harris ' roots in Uriah Heep / UFO British hard rock of the early / mid 1970s .

This is a time of great music that in my opinion.  You just don't hear any more or see.  And, ended somewhere in the 90's.  I guess every generation goes through it.  Like when Rock and Roll came along.  The generation before it.  Did not like it.","There is a time to die . A time to cry , etc . This is a time of great music Like Did not like it ."

A3RC3AK8UN89I9,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Cher's newest offering is 2001's LIVING PROOF, this is the version that was released in the UK before the US got a copy. The UK version features ""You Take It All"", which in my opinion, is the best track of the album. Instead the US version has ""When You Walk Away"", which is not available on this UK version. Cher once again provides some songs with inspiration and strength, like ""Alive Again"", ""Song For The Lonely"", ""Love One Another"", which all have messages of love and acceptance and moving on. Another favorite track of mine is the dark techno sounding ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"". The only songs I couldn't get into are the latin influenced ""Body To Body, Heart To Heart"", and ""Rain, Rain"". The rest of the tracks are winners, however I feel there could have been a better choice for a single than ""When The Money's Gone"". I love her version of ""The Music's No Good Without You"", which was the first UK single, a nice dark trance type track. ""Real Love"" stands out, it has a nice Daft Punk-ish sound to it. Overall LIVING PROOF is living proof, that Cher still has the goods!","which in my opinion , is the best track of the album . which is not available on this UK version .
