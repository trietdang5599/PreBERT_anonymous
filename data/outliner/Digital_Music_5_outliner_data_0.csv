A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel...and how would that work out?  It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well.  I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and didn't find the need to go back to this as this style of music and production doesn't fit her folksy shape and leanings.  A big part of her draw is her earthy, grounded guitar and other natural instrumental sounds; you won't find much of that here.  This synth-pop-techno music strips away some of her soul.  Still, even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever, even beneath and through so much digitization.

1) Stand: it's okay.  Starting us off with Jewel's voice front and center as uninspired, syncopated beats and some buzzes chirp here and there.  ""Reach"" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well.
2) Run 2 U: her lovely,soft voice saves a song without musical importance.
3) Intuition: Singing twice and three times over her own voice and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this otherwise forgettable piece.
4) Leave the Lights On: Now here's something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds and a bluesy style.  Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far.
5) 2 Find U: Weak.
6) Fragile Heart: A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked.  Too slow, though.
7) Doin' Fine: ""We are what everyone wants to be.""  We are doin' fine.  Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay.
8) 2 Become 1: The music is much more engaging and natural.  This feels like a Jewel song and could be on any one of her albums (minus the way she is ""spells"" the song title...).
9) Haunted: A seductive and creepy song.  Totally cool and different.  Uh, and kinda sensuous.  Jewel's moaning at the end of the song is...well, let's just say that I'm glad that it doesn't go on too long.
10) Sweet Temptation: Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs.
11) Yes U Can: This one might just make you dance.  Again, a love and sex song that is both a joinder and a cautious observation.  It is minorly infectious.
12) U & Me = Love: Dance pop bubblegum fluff.  Blech.
13) America: Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed.  It's okay, unless you're tired of hearing popsters and others bagging on America.  Not nearly one of her best social observation songs (probably because it's so politicized).
14) Becoming: Lyrically well-suited to the empty dance-pop genre, Jewel witnesses her own ""becoming"" with her heart.  Ahhh, isn't that nice.  Maudlin stuff.

As you might have guessed this isn't my favorite Jewel album.  But there is at least one gem on here and a few other songs that work.  If you're interested in what Jewel has to offer I'd highly suggest starting elsewhere (personally, I'd direct you to ""This Way"") and if you like your techno-dance-pop I'd look somewhere else too.","that I was getting something different with this Jewel ... that work out ?

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B009IFYYIC,1,-1,3,"You know you've seen them. You know what I'm talking about. You know the men who look slightly off because there is something just slightly askew about their appearance. You know, the men who should be graying, but they're still trying to look young, and so they dye their hair a dark color and it makes them look odd and pasty? Well, that's ""Songs for the End of the World"" and Rick Springfield at this point.

Something is just off. Why doesn't Rick look 63? Why does his music sound like it's for kids? Oh sure, he's adapted, unfortunately he's adapted to Blink 182, Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco, and all the other bland trendy emo/punk bands of the last decade. Now sure, Rick rocks and he rolls, but he just doesn't bring the hooks and melodies. He gussies his songs up and tries to knock your socks off, but it just comes off like some kind of weird overcompensation. Like someone who is trying really really hard to sound hip and not old.

And this bothers me. You see, Lindsey Buckingham, Tom Waits and Bruce Springsteen were also all born in 1949 just like Rick. If you listen to each of their last albums you will hear (and see) that they have aged gracefully, doing their own thing, not trying to go with the trends, and they all still bring the hooks and melodies and (look their age) and sound respectable. But Rick here, well, you see, he's like that guy I was talking about earlier--the guy who is old but pretends to be young and it doesn't work (or look quite right).

My first Springfield cassette was 1984's ""Hard to Hold"", and I've stuck with him ever since. But you know, when I went back and listened to all of the albums I own leading up to this new release, the one thing I came away with is that Rick is more of a singles guy rather than an album guy. Every album of his has some really good tracks rounded out with filler. ""Songs for the End of the World"" is no different.

In fact, the strongest songs are at the front with ""Wide Awake"", ""Our Ship's Sinking"" and ""I Hate Myself"" being the best songs on the entire disc. I suppose ""Gabriel"" is decent, and maybe ""You & Me"". I liked ""One Way Street"", but all I could think about is how the guitar intro comes dangerously close to The Who's ""Pinball Wizard"". And again, although Rick has updated his sound, he has now churned out the same album at least three times--2004's ""Shock/Denial/Anger/Acceptance"" and 2008's ""Venus in Overdrive"" and now ""Songs"". And although I've enjoyed Rick's output since 1999, the honest truth is (and you know it's True if you're being honest with yourself here) that Rick's best work was with RCA. You know 1981 to 1988. That was when he was at his best. From 1999 to 2012, well that's just Rick keeping pace and sounding (and looking) slightly off.

I believe Rick has one great album left in him, but will he dispense with this emo/punk/pop sheen that he thinks will keep him younger, and just go for it. Just give us the power pop snyth/guitar melodies that made his 1980s work so good. He can just update the instruments.

Obviously Rick still has some rabid fans because five stars for ""Songs"" is just not possible. It isn't five stars, and it isn't the best album of his career. Like most of his recent work it's just good. Also, the gimmick of using your iPhone application to recognize photos on the insert is kind of cheesy. I did it, and the extra content did not impress me, and there wasn't that much.

I'm going to be the lone voice of reason here and take the heat by saying that it's okay Rick, you can age now, you can give us what we want--your gray hair and pop melodies that actually sound like you and not the band of the moment. It's okay to show some wrinkles and fat, you've earned it. It's okay to make more than one or two hits per album. I give you my permission to make a 12 song or 10 song set that will stand as your Sgt. Peppers.

It's also okay to not make every song sound almost the same as the next, a problem I found with ""Songs"".

Also, isn't it about time someone did something about the Springfield catalog? I mean, where's the digitally remastered catalog with bonus tracks or bonus discs? Heck, where's Rick's first five albums from the 1970s? Terribly hard to find in compact disc except for a few. ""Wait for Night"" and ""Beautiful Feelings"" near impossible to find on compact disc. Will we ever get to hear the original ""Beautiful Feelings"" or will it remain just the 1984 re-recordings?

Here's how ""Songs for the End of the World"" compares to Rick's other works:

1972 Beginnings: I haven't heard this.
1973 Comic Book Heroes: I haven't heard this.

A3S9IDI1V2WQQ1,B00EWS5IO4,1,-1,3,"This is a review of ""Miami pop festival"" the Jimi Hendrix experience. I liberated a copy of this CD from a local big box store tonight, before it's True release. So I have listened to it twice and here is my take: for $9.99, this is a three star purchase. There is some interesting banter and a tuning session by Jimi, which showcases just how novel these large festivals were in the late 60s. This particular festival was set in May of 1968 and promoted by Michael Lang, of pre-Woodstock fame.

The songs on this live disc come mainly from ""Are You Experienced...?"" even though it's mid '68. The first track is a funny little whimsical 60s back and forth that descends into the tuning session referenced earlier.  Track two opens with a cool jam intro with punching kick drums from Mitch Mitchell and phased out feedback laden guitar from Jimi- just before launching into a nicely rearranged introduction of ""hey Joe."" The solo in this song really kicks. The next song, Foxy Lady, blasts off. The intro contains a whole lotta Uni-Vibe and phasing. One nice aspect is that the mixes, which were done originally by Kramer and then later remixed for this project by Eddie Kramer are tight.

 The next song ""Tax-free"" is a nice jam with some heavy crybaby floating throughout. Noel Redding's bass guitar is right up there in the mix in the correct place, sonically speaking. Mitch has a cool tempo altering drum solo that really starts swinging as Jimmy comes back in with some blistering wah-wah guitar. The on and off mic banter is amusing and entertaining, as it shows just how novel and inexperienced the promoters and the sound technicians were at setting up these kinds of shows in the early, nascent  stages of festival going.

 I will avoid the common bashing of Janie Hendrix and the whole experience Hendrix cash grab machine that so many complain about. What else can be said about this process? There is very limited material that Mr. Hendrix produced while he was alive. Most of it has already been heard many times over. We are scraping the bottom of the barrel, of course, ending up with products like ""Valleys of Neptune ""which was decent and acceptable and overall a good listen. So with all of that said, this is a decent product. In fact it is rather good for a live recording. The only problem is the lack of material. The fact that two songs are repeated is troubling.

The accompanying booklet with photographs that show Jimmy with his Olympic white Fender Strat are very nice and well done. The packaging is actually quite nice as well. So for $10, this is a marginal three-star buy. Put some other records ahead of it in your musical shopping list, like Paul McCartney's new album or even some of those dreaded repackagings of prior releases that I loathe. The only one I would say to avoid at all costs is The Band at the Academy of Arts (aka ""Rock of Aged""). That one is a great example of a lame cash grab. Sad for such an amazing group. Ive heard NOTHING good about it!

PS-I would listen to this a million times before ever suffering through friggin' ARCADE FIRE and their Ambien-rock-electronic crap that Rolling Stone seems to love so much. Get over yourself DAVID FRICKE!","This is a review of "" Miami pop festival "" the Jimi Hendrix experience . I liberated a copy of this CD from a local big box store tonight , before it is True release . There is some interesting banter which showcases just how novel these large festivals were in the late 60s . This particular festival was set in May of 1968 and promoted by Michael Lang , of pre - Woodstock fame . The first track is a funny little whimsical 60s back Track two opens with a cool jam intro with punching kick drums from Mitch Mitchell and phased out feedback laden guitar from Jimi- just before launching into a nicely rearranged introduction of "" hey Joe . "" One nice aspect is The next song "" Tax - free "" is a nice jam with some heavy crybaby floating throughout . Noel Redding 's bass guitar is right up there in the mix in the correct place , sonically speaking . Mitch has a cool tempo altering drum solo that really starts swinging as Jimmy comes back in with some blistering wah - wah guitar . and off mic banter is amusing and entertaining , as it shows just how novel and inexperienced the promoters and the sound technicians were at setting up these kinds of shows in the early , nascent   stages of festival going . I will avoid the common bashing of Janie Hendrix that so many complain about . There is very limited material that Mr. Hendrix produced while he was alive . We are scraping the bottom of the barrel , of course , ending up with products like "" Valleys of Neptune "" which was decent and acceptable and overall a good listen . that said , this is a decent product . In fact it is rather good for a live recording . The only problem is the lack of material . that two songs are repeated is troubling . that show Jimmy with his Olympic white Fender Strat are very nice and well done . The packaging is actually quite nice as well . So for $ 10 , this is a marginal three - star buy .

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B0014JAM04,1,-1,2,"It seems to be a staple for rock groups to do a ballad, and even show off their softer side. Sometimes it comes off touching and sweet, sometimes darker and more haunting, and sometimes just plain amazing. See Hawk Nelson's brilliantly haunting ""Fourteen"" for case and point. But then again, sometimes it's just straight up ballad just for ballad's sake. Case in point, Secondhand Serenade's ""Fall For You.""

This piano ballad is about as boring as it is emotionless and unoriginal, and believe me, this will cause you to fall asleep at the wheel. It may please any AC fan, or any fan of this type of song, but from a guy whose pretty much heard it all, I've heard this one before, and done a whole lot better. However, I may be a sucker for the piano, but the musical work here is pretty good.

So overall, from the vocals to the lyrics, A-Z, 1, 2, 3, this song doesn't do anything for me, except put me to sleep. The whole song was probably written to appease a record exec who wanted something to sell, which isn't bad, except when you put no work into it. Unoriginal and Boring are not desirable qualities I like in my music, so if you're into that, this is for you. I'll just keep my distance.","and even show off their softer side . and sweet , sometimes darker and more haunting , and sometimes just plain amazing .

A37VF0LNXK0IA6,B00DY9A8NI,1,-1,3,"This is a decent mp3 set of various works by Tchaikovsky, heavy on works for orchestra. The best parts here are the less frequently heard works, such as the Orchestral Suites 2 & 4, the Piano Trio in A minor, The Seasons, the Danish Festival Overture and others. The version of the Manfred Symphony is really good, and it has been for a long time one of my favorite lesser known Tchaikovsky works. However, on the down side, the more familiar pieces in this set just do not seem to be very good performances. The numbered symphonies all sound bland and lifeless.(BTW-where is the Symphony No. 3, the Polish? You can't put in every symphony, including the Manfred, and leave out one of the earlier ones.) The piano and violin concertos also sound barely decent. The ballets are a strange mixture. You get the complete Nutcracker, (though split up over several tracks in a very frustrating way) seven or eight pieces from Swan Lake, and a single excerpt from Sleeping Beauty. What's up with that? The suite from each one would have sufficed, if that's how they were going to do it. The chamber pieces were decent, though it would have been nice to see the sextet version of Souvenier de Florence instead of the string orchestra version. And the piano pieces were barely noticed.
  Overall, if you are a newbie to Tchaikovsky and aren't too picky on the quality of the performances, you might want to try this out. At 99 cents it's not terrible. But if not, then just cherry pick this set for the Manfred and the Orchestral Suites. Plus the Piano Trio. -------------PEACE","This is a decent mp3 set of various works by Tchaikovsky , heavy on works for orchestra .

O.N.I.F.C. (Only N**** In First Class/One Night In First Class) is the worst of all. And one would expect this to be good after the mixtape Taylor Allerdice, which was good as well.

Production heren is good. You can tell that Wiz picked the beats that have the nice long vibing sounds, which is heard all over this album. The best songs on here are the ones he colabs with other artists. ""Let It Go"" has Akon singing the chorus around Wiz' braggadocious lyrics. ""The Bluff"" has Cam'ron spitting a good verse. Even 2 Chainz sounds refreshing on ""Its Nothin"". And his Taylor Gang crew members sound better than him on ""The Plan"" and ""Medicated"". The single ""Remember You"" with The Weeknd sounds good, but having Abel lead off the song and sing the chorus and has Wiz rhyme about something totally different makes the song almost a waste. There are a small number of solo songs that Wiz has that he can hold his own, but don't expect much from those.

-Food

-What You See

These songs are hot. Pay $4 to download these, and put the other $5 toward the full Czarface album. Or use them to download DTD, It's What It Is, ENY House, and East MC's from his other albums.

As an album, I think it's MK's weakest. I have no problem w/ the fact that he's pursuing a different sound and doesn't have any Wu features. I think MK can stand on his own two feet, and I like his style. He really shines on those 4 tracks I mentioned.

The problem is that there are only a couple other actual songs, and those didn't do much for me, and once you subtract a couple of skit-type tracks and a few forgettable spoken word tracks, there's really not enough on here to justify calling it an album. Compare to the number of actual songs (i.e., with rap verses) on, say, Wu-Block or, again, Czarface.

I'm saying, if Killa's gonna call this an album and expect my $10 (which he got), he needs to deliver at least 10-15 actual rap songs.","There are some really solid tracks on this album .

A1IIUCG9TJFUWS,B005A31ROK,-1,1,5,"""Yeah, well... there's the ultimate `production record,'"" was my first thought, upon first hearing this. (A ""production record,"" of course, is anything built ENTIRELY behind the board.) ANYBODY could have sung the vox, in other words... ANYBODY could have built the drum-track on any old laptop, ANYBODY could have built the bass line with a phlanger add-in to Reason -- and ANYBODY could have the mixed the whole thing with PT on any old PC in anybody's basement.

The truth is, however, that the track NOT a by-the-numbers piece from RedOne's assembly line - and that's a very cool thing indeed: it is, instead, a self-crafted little gem from a duo straight out of nowhere, Colorado. Yeah, it SOUNDS (initially) like a crunk-core version of any other production record; it has every hallmark of every other major-label McCookie McCutter record-of-the-moment (which will be history the very moment that THIS PARTICULAR SPLIT-SECOND passes the world by) - BUT THIS ONE HAS SOMETHING ELSE: this one has THAT EXACT AND SPECIFIC something else; that special, intoxicating, can't-quite-put-your-finger-on-it THANG that hits just the right mix of jarring yet cool and yet utterly NEW genre-mashing... that THANG which leads to monster hit records -- which, ultimately, turn-out to be so massive that they lead to the direct creation of entirely new sub-genres within modern pop.

It's THAT damn huge.

BLACKOUT is simply ALL KINDS of massive.

Breathe Carolina mix electronica with post-hardcore; they mix autotune with vocorder while screaming vox into the red. In other words, they break EVERY rule. ""Um, yeah... guys, that's not supposed to work."" It DOES, though: it works PERFECTLY. And that's the crux: they mix clean with unclean vocals AND EFFECTS; they mix all of those exact and specific things which AIN'T SUPPOSED TO WORK AT MASS MARKET ON THE BIG CHART AT ALL. They take EVERY musical risk, is what I'm trying to say; they take EVERY wrong turn and almost dare the song to fall apart, and, oh man... is it EVAR cool. I mean, it's just hella HELLA cool... it's just all kinds of goddang awesome. In other words, what they have here is something that every label on Earth is constantly searching for, and yet so rarely find: A sound that is blazingly unique, blindingly frigging original, and ooooohhh-sooooo-insanely-commercial. You can almost SMELL the platinum.

Blackout is a MONSTER. As I write this, the song has yet to chart, anywhere. I heard the track on middle-of-the-night Minnesota radio, and I could hardly imagine the jing this thing will pull, like a magnet, from iTunes. It IS, simply, the record of the year. I can't even count the possible ringtones in this thing; there's gotta be at least a hundred Million worth of ringtone$ in Blackout. It's the edgiest thing to hit the big chart (WHEN it hits, that is) in a good long while... the style is BRAZEN; the record is a textbook on FLAIR. It's just gripping, man... the band rips through its chorii like Bon Jovi on steroids. It's anthemic, and you just can't turn it off. Even after it ends, you find yourself turning-off the radio just to re-listen, in your head, to what you've just heard.

It's the Bay City Rollers doing Linkin Park covers -- as if they were produced by RedOne and mixed by Bob Rock.

Absolutely MASSIVE.

It is the most rock oriented song on this album. By and large this is a mellow affair, with covers of ""Tonight,"" from West Side Story, and ""Cast Your Fate TO The Wind.""

But what makes We Five so good is they keep their vocal music in a folk vain. There is little orchestration here, and this music thus sounds like it could have been sung by 1960s college kids strumming on a street corner.

And We Five maintained their excellence: when most vocal groups were getting more sappy as rock got harder, We Five pushed in a more rustic and rocky direction.

A29AQW33B8ILM1,B01DQ6ON70,1,-1,3,"Volbeat's sound is very recognizable, now more than ever thanks to heavy rotation on the radio. Songs like ""Heaven nor Hell"" and ""Lola Montez"" catapulted this group to mainstream status in a major way. However, they also seem to have resulted in less heavy riffs and more towards melodic hard rock. Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies was where this transformation really got started, even though the group has always had its share of melodic hard rock. There were generally more heavy riffs. Outlaws Gentlemen had some good riffs on tracks like ""Dead But Rising"", ""The Hangman's Body Count"", and ""Doc Holiday"", but in general was pretty much melodic hard rock. This album follows that trend, but even further in my opinion. Tracks such as ""The Devils Bleading Crown"" and ""The Loa's Crossroad""  bookend the disc on somewhat heavy notes, but everything in between is catchy melodic hard rock. Sadly this group is falling into Nickelback status with how formulated their albums are becoming. Their one saving grace is they aren't doing cheesy love songs. The riffs and vocals though are becoming too similar with each disc. I understand the ""if it's not broken, don't fix it"" mentality. It's worked for many mainstream bands, but it does wear thin on those who would like a bit more creativity. Not talking about reinvention or anything, because that often leads to even more backlash, but something to mix things up a bit would be nice in the furture.","Volbeat 's sound is very recognizable , now more than ever thanks to heavy rotation on the radio .

Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies was where this transformation really got started , even though the group has always had its share of melodic hard rock . Outlaws Gentlemen had some good riffs on tracks like "" Dead and "" Doc Holiday "" , but in general was pretty much melodic hard rock . Tracks such as "" The Devils Bleading Crown "" but everything in between is catchy melodic hard rock . Sadly this group is falling into Nickelback status with how formulated their albums are becoming . Their one saving grace is they are not doing cheesy love songs . I understand the "" if it is not broken , do not fix it "" mentality . It is worked for many mainstream bands , who would like a bit more creativity . because that often leads to even more backlash , that often leads to even more backlash , but something to mix things up a bit would be nice in the furture .",4.000000

AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B00BEBM9JY,1,-1,3,"For those who are unaware, Rodney Crowell used to be part of Emmylou Harris' Hot Band, way back in the mid-'70s.  Crowell went onto his own success as a songwriter and artist (and Rosanne Cash's first husband).

Fast forward 30-odd years later and Harris and Crowell have finally put out an album together, 'Old Yellow Moon'.  While it had been in the works for a while, it was finally released recently.  I was SO looking forward to this when I heard about it almost a year ago.

For all of Crowell's songwriting skills, only four of the dozen songs are his - the rest are covers from other artists, which is actually Harris' strength.

I really like both artists, so why am I not fully digging 'Old Yellow Moon'?  Was the anticipation too high?

There are some tunes are old country like, that both performed back in the day - and they can be good (""Chase the Feeling"", ""Invitation to the Blues"", ""Bluebird Wine"", ""Bull Rider"" and ""Open Season on My Heart""), but I would be hard pressed to say any were great.

Harris has some really good leads (""Spanish Dancer"").  Crowell does ok on a few.  Then there are some that should really work well and don't quite deliver (""Back When We Were Beautiful"").  And then there are one or two that just kind of drag down the disk (""Black Caffeine"" for example).

Harris still has an incredible voice and I like Crowell as a solo artist and as a songwriter and producer.  I'm not sure why he didn't produce this (or write more songs for this), as it was handled by Harris' ex-husband and the man who helmed a number of her disks in the '70s and '80s (and one or two of her last disks).

Perhaps the disk will grow on me, but I didn't get a great first or second impression.  It's fine - but with artists like these, you expect more than fine.","who are unaware , Rodney Crowell used to be part of Emmylou Harris ' Hot Band , way back in the mid-'70s .

A1S2IY37JU93XS,B001IQMCZQ,1,-1,3,"Ever since the release of the ultra-successful The Emancipation of MiMi, by Mariah Carey, it seems as though record labels are constantly overthinking things in order to get hits, especially when they have an artist who is truly talented on their hands, like Jennifer Hudson. That would probably explain why the best song Jennifer Hudson has ever recorded, the lovely ""Stand Up,"" is nowhere to be found here. Quite honestly, this is not the classic album I was expecting from such a talented woman. Still, there are some nice songs. ""Spotlight"" is probably the best thing on here; it's light, but forceful, and its sparse production leaves ample room for Jennifer's powerful and emtional vocal delivery. The Timbaland-produced ""Pocketbook"" is pretty much the only moment on the album where she doesn't take herself so seriously, which makes it refreshing. It's sassy and silly (""don't make me hit you with my pocketbook""), but the track is almost ruined by Ludacris' unnecessarily nasty rap. The Robin Thicke-penned ""Giving Myself,"" a simple and beautiful ballad, was a nice choice. The piano-laden ""My Heart"" is very catchy and an overall nice mid-tempo. ""I'm His Only Woman,"" a duet with Fantasia, pays homage to Stax-era soul. ""We Gon' Fight"" is standard Tank fare, but it's enjoyable. And the closer, a rendition of the gospel traditional ""Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There,"" shows her vocals at their best. The rest of the songs, I'm afraid, are anything but satisfying and many of them are extremely trendy, meaning that there are songs all across the radio that sound similar. Luckily, Hudson's voice elevates all of these from being embarrassingly bad, except on the biggest monstrosity: the duet with... T-Pain, ""What's Wrong (Go Away)."" 'Nuff said, it's inexcusible. ""If This Isn't Love"" is a bit too pop for my tastes. I can't believe artists are still calling up Diane Warren for songs, because in my opinion, she was finished almost a decade ago. Anyways, her addition, ""You Pulled me Through"" is pretty uninspiring. ""Can't Stop the Rain"" has a generally nice melody and has touching lyrics, but the production is very stale. ""Invisible"" isn't very exciting, either, and the chorus is too dramatic. And the inclusion of ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"" was pretty unnecessary in my eyes, especially since I--and probably the rest of America--had grown tired of it by the time the Academy Awards came around. Contrary to what other reviewers are saying, ""All Dressed Up In Love"" is not included as a bonus track on the standard edition. As I said before, all this material is made better due to the simple fact that it's Jennifer Hudson singing, and there are six or seven good tracks. But there are just as many songs that should've been left off, and with over 40 tracks recorded for this album, you'd think Hudson and Clive Davis could've formulated a great tracklist. If you want an excellent new female R&B album, buy Jazmine Sullivan's Fearless, because this just isn't cutting it for me. Maybe next time.","Ever since the release of the ultra - successful The Emancipation of MiMi , by Mariah Carey , it seems as though record labels are constantly overthinking things in order to get hits , especially who is truly talented on their hands , like Jennifer Hudson . why the best song Jennifer Hudson has ever recorded , the lovely "" Stand Up , "" is nowhere to be found here .

A11GY1G10WSE8,B00123IBSC,1,-1,2,"For such a ""much anticipated"" return to the recording studio by this legendary superband which dominated the radio in the 70's and 80's, this effort falls short of expectations.  While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD, including an energetic ""90 Degrees and Freezing"", a Motown-inspired, horn driven ""Come to Me Do"" and a catchy and powerful pop gem ""Feel"" (all penned by all-time great songwriter Robert Lamm), the record suffers from an over-abundance of ballads and sorry, over-blown production. I'm not a producer, but I know what sounds good to my ears.
I have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album, but the ones on this Chicago album, the first recording of all-original material in 15 years, are simply not good, whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint. I won't go down the list, but will cite ""King of Might Have Been"" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range.
I don't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD, but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band, Rascal Flatts. No more to say as this speaks for itself.  As confirmed by the band, DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording, and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on ""XXX"". Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop/rock/R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings, a CD of Chicago-only songs would, undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on ""XXX"".
Finally, DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members, thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance.

I learned a couple of things about this duo who scraped together different styles as they were developing their own harmonic sounds. This record is pretty much an acoustic fare with their voices and guitars and their original works like Sparrow and The Sound of Silence and He Was My Brother stand head and shoulders above their covering of others songs (yes, even above Bob Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin). The mix is like a stew that gives you different flavors and textures in each bite, and doesnt taste like it really goes together, but every so often you get a particular savory taste that hits some of the right notes and you realize that you're willing to try more.

The three disc Master of Puppets release is by far the best one for the affordable versions. The remaster here has some slight tweaking, but otherwise sounds nearly the same as the old disc. Dynamic range is still very good for metal. If you want to revisit these classics, these cheap editions are the way to do it.

This record is also somehow heavier than the previous albums, and has much more obtrusive production courtesy of JOHNNY K, who has worked with STAIND, SEVENDUST, and DISTURBED.

So she went with ""Obsessed"" her first single off of the then anticipated follow up to ""E=MC2"", ""Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel"".

It's an upbeat song about dissing someone who dissed her husband, her relationship and is ""obsessed"" with her for some odd reason.

""See right through you like you're bathing in windex"" is one of the many insults she puts inside the song.

At first I wasn't sure about the song and didn't think much of it but it grew on me almost immensely and now I really do like it.

And thank goodness it wasn't played out nearly as much as a Beyonce song or a Lil' Wayne song!

AOWZ87AGIR2VU,B00NPZI1ZS,1,-1,3,"To put in perspective where this Pink Floyd fan is coming from, my first album bought was Obscured By Couds as a new release. I then bought Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother, Meddle, and the Syd Barrett re-releases of Saucerful and Piper (which I later sold because, I never ever did see his ""genius"", just as one more Crazy Diamond). Then came DSOTM and I have always hated the song Money, but liked most of the album except for all the alarms. Eventually, the very cynical Animals became my all time favorite and I liked them all the way up to Division Bell. I liked The Wall and The Final Cut, but felt that these were just absolutely brilliant lyrical venting on Roger's part, which had all of us paying fans acting as his psychiatric couch. Must be nice, which is why I welcomed Momentary Lapse Of Reason and still love that one.

So, I got really psyched up when I found out about this release and researched it until I could find leaked You Tube songs. The first ones that I heard really threw me for a loop and I got prepared for a nasty one star review calling it the soundtrack for old hippies in nursing homes. Worse than that, I was going to call it Nick Mason's last attempt at milking the udders from the cow on Atom Heart Mother for all it's worth. Instead, it is none of these nasty descriptions. What made me change my mind? I watched Anisina on You Tube and got some 5-star goose bumps. However, the only other cut that rises to this level is Surfacing.

So, just like the teenager from 40 years ago who also still does not trust the Post Office to lose his stuff, I went out and bought it locally today. I was not about to wait one more week to hear this one! The verdict: the ones that sound anything at all like Pink Floyd are few and far between on this already short album. The winners are by track number: 2, 4, 7, 11, 13, 17. Track number 5 will not make it to my iPod as it is a soundtrack for a bad trip (eventhough no one has time for that kind of thing anymore). Track number 18 is the only one with vocals and also will not make it to my iPod because the opening line sums up the part that I have hated about this band airing out their dirty laundry, ""We bitch and we fight"". Speaking of which, does anyone else notice that mainly British bands fight amongst themselves, hold grudges for years, and are also obsessed with lunacy? Get over it and give us some more good music!!!!

The 6 out of 18 cuts mentioned make for a worthwhile purchase, with Anisina being worth the price all by itself. An instant clasic cut! For those who want further clarification, I would call this genre as ""Instrumental Soundtrack"", but definitely not ""Progressive Psychedelic"", as all of their previous albums were. Do yourself a favor and check out the full videos from the tracks that I mentioned, and then decide if you want this one as a keeper. Not for everyone, but this is certainly

But for his latest single, Blame It, the second single from his 3rd album Intuition, feels honestly more like a lackluster vibe than imagined. I sadly didn't feel it was a driven R&B song that hit the nail on the head, unlike recent tracks from Solange', Kanye West, or others that've been strong on the soul.

While I was driving through Norway's beautiful Lofoten Islands I came across 3 young Swiss backpackers hitch hiking along the side of the road. They had to get to Moskenes and hop on a ferry to get to Bodos (Norwegian mainland). Given the time of day, I realized I had to just drive them to the ferry terminal or they would have to camp in the cold Norwegian night. Along the drive the 3 Swiss students translated the German version of the Nena's 99 Luftballon into English for me. They were a Swiss German speakers so they did not fully understand what Nena was saying, but he German version is lot more interesting. The German version has nothing to with 99 red balloons. Rather it is about mis-identifying 99 air balloons (weather balloons) which lead to 99 years of war.

These songs were recorded just weeks and months before his passing. His whispers are haunting though, on tracks like ""Ain't No Grave,"" because he obviously understands that his life is coming to an end.

I'm not familiar with a lot of these songs, and to be honest, I wish there were more songs here for Johnny to sing. I don't think his version of ""Aloha Oe"" will be remembered as one of his greatest recordings ever, so the album feels a little too light, but maybe that's the point.

From the first time I heard David Draiman say muahahah in the radio hit song ""Down With the Sickness,"" I have not found a Disturbed track that didn't sound cheesy, for lack of a better word. That is why I was so surprised to find out that Draiman is the voice behind Device. I listened to the clips of the songs on Amazon before I read the reviews, so I was already interested in the music before the relation to Disturbed could turn me off. Speaking of the music, it is very heavy. Some reviewers have commented on the industrial aspects of the album, but any similarities between True industrial and Device end at the processed drums and guitars and a few synth noises. If you told a fan of KMFDM that Device was industrial, they would probably laugh at you. Of course, I don't care for KMFDM or True industrial, so Device's industrial-lite metal is okay with me. I was initially drawn to the album by the album's heaviness and Draiman's voice. Without knowing who was singing, I thought the singer was topnotch. Now that I own the album and know that the singer is David Draiman of Disturbed, I am going to go back and give Disturbed's catalog another listen. I do have one issue with what I consider an otherwise great album. Sadly, Device is seriously lacking in guitar leads. In place of leads, Draiman has inserted a number of melodic bridges into the songs. I'm not sure why he chose not to include leads in his songs; they would only have added to the music, but perhaps, being a singer, he saw the parts of the songs where leads would normally be as an opportunity to highlight his vocal abilities. All in all, the album is an enjoyable listen. I would recommend it to fans of all kinds of heavy music from Sevendust and Drowning Pool to Soilwork and Scar Symmetry.","I have never been a fan of Disturbed .

After his wildly successful debut single, 1962's ""Sheila"", Tommy Roe went on to make 21 more appearances on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart over the next decade. A strong argument can be made that his 1966 Top Ten smash ""Sweet Pea"" was really the very first ""bubblegum"" hit. Recall that the term ""bubblegum"" did not appear until the heyday of Buddah records in 1968-1969 with groups like Ohio Express and the 1910 Fruitgum Co. At least one reviewer has complained that this is NOT the original recording.  I think he is correct but it really does not vary all that much from the original.

Cooper appears on the back cover with slicked back short hair, long sleeved dress shirt and a tie.  A complete 360 from his para military character from his last incarnation on ""Special Forces"".  This is another short one only being around 30 minutes long.  Album sales were close to rock bottom by this time with the album not even charting.  I did hear ""I Like Girls"" on my local AOR station a few times, but that was about it.  Although it gets panned by a lot of Cooper heads, I like a lot of this disc.  You get the feeling that Cooper is just having fun with a lot of this stuff, as much of the album is very light hearted and humorous.  Highlights include ""Zorro's Ascent"" a song about Alice Cooper as Zorro.  How he thought up this one I'll never know, but it is funny and cleaver.  Three songs in the middle all run together ""Adaptable"", ""I Like Girls"", and ""Remarkably Insincere"".  They are all short punchy rock songs with funny lyrics.  ""Tag You're It"" sees Alice as a horror movie director.......or is he really a killer?  This is a great song and harkens back to his ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" days.  ""It Better Be Good"" is another short fun rocker. On the other side of the coin there is some pretty dreadful stuff on this album as well.  ""I Am The Future"" sounds like it is from the cheesy movie soundtrack where it originated.  ""No Baloney Homosapiens"" is, well just look at the title and you can pretty much guess.  ""I'm Alive"" is another clunker that closes out the album.  Alice did not even tour around this album and it came and went pretty quickly.  Still, I like most of it and it is defiantly one of Cooper's most ""fun"" albums.","This one has to be Alice 's most inconsistent albums .

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B01BKYPCIY,1,-1,3,"The problem I have with Stefani's music is that it's like candy--sweet and sickly at the same time. Ultimately, her music leaves you with a sugar crash afterward. I have all three of her solo cds, plus all of No Doubt's cds. I didn't enjoy the last No Doubt cd either.

""This Is What The Truth Feels Like..."" is Stefani's first solo work in 10 years. This is probably the best of the three solo albums. It is certainly her most mature. Most of the irritating idiosyncrasies from her first two cds are scrubbed out here to good results. The only clunker here is ""Naughty"" which just comes off as so amateurish for a 46 year old woman.

There's much to like here, and there should be hit singles all around, but things have changed in the past 10 years, and Stefani also passed that popular music death mark--age 40. I notice that none of her past four singles released between 2014 and now have cracked the Top 40. This is a shame, because I'd rather listen to Stefani than Gomez, Lorde, Azalea, Lovato, Jepsen, and a whole host of other young ladies.

I give ""This Is What The Truth Feels Like..."" three and a half stars because it's good, but not quite four stars. There's always a sort of over-produced quality to Stefani's music that strips it of having real emotional impact and resonance. She can't create an album without at least eight different producers on it, which gives all of her albums an uneven quality to them.

""Misery"", ""You're My Favorite"", ""Make Me Like You"", ""Truth"", and ""Used To Love You"" are the best tracks here, and the most likely candidates for a Top 40 hit.

Bring on the next No Doubt album. Here's how ""This Is What The Truth Feels Like..."" compares to Stefani's other work:

2004 Love. Angel. Music. Baby.: Two and a Half Stars
2005 The Great Escape: Three Stars

As a singer who's taken the opportunity to perform in works such as the musical film 'Dreamgirls', his interests include neo-soul styles as well as club-focused hip-hop and even a bit of new jack swing. This album doesn't just bring him together with collaborators such as Kanye West and T.I., though, but frequently buries his talented voice with a lot of slick production.

Foxx's scattershot approach could've made for a well-rounded album, but it feels more like a mixed bag than anything. Some tracks have a particular appeal to them while others seem more average than anything. ""Blame It"" became a major radio hit at the time of release, although as a pop rap single it's nothing special.

As long as you dress it up with enough effects pedals. He got half a duet with Ingle too--a fantasia built on (would you believe) ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"". So when Atco edited out everything but the vocal section, you got three reps each of the verse and refrain. So it didn't make much of a single. Be warned--you're better off with the album.","The other 14 minutes were a jam featuring an organ solo by Doug Ingle , a guitar solo by Erik Brann As long as you dress it up with enough effects pedals .

A11L90R7RWJA8H,B00386JZ4U,1,-1,3,"In the mid-sixties A&M was a soft pop label known for easy listening / adult contemporary sounds. The vocal harmonies of We Five fit right in. To enjoy this album you're really going to have to like their harmonies as applied to the standard operating procedure of MOR albums of the day: an album would have a single or two (or none) padded with covers of standards or show tunes or other popular hits of the day.

Of the twelve songs, one is the hit single title track, three are penned by John Stewart of the Kingston Trio (soon to have a #1 song with the Monkees singing his ""Daydream Believer""), and the rest are a random assortment of show tunes. I picked up this album as well as the second,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Make-Someone-Happy/dp/B00386OKYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Make Someone Happy</a>, from the used bins a few years ago. We Five's sound is pleasing to the ear but the MOR playlist lends a generic touch to their legacy; this playlist could have come from the Sandpipers but We Five turned up for the recording session instead.

Unless you're seriously jonesing to relive memories of this album echoing through the hallways of the college dorm, you're probably better off downloading the one hit, sampling the others and seeing which might round out your We Five selections.

Its 22 tracks harvest the hit here along with the three John Stewart songs, highlights comprising two thirds of the second album, and more.

She had been absent from making music for quite a long time, not just on her own, but also with No Doubt. Last year, the group returned after nearly a decade from making catchy songs. They didn't hit the nail on the head they had wanted with Settle Down. The song was good, but not as strong as what they had before. Baby Don't Lie, Gwen's latest solo song isn't, bad honestly not overwhelming. The song is catchy, but not as good as her earlier songs from her career Sweet Escape, Rich Girl, Hollaback Girl and others to name a few. Still, it is a decent song, and definitely much better than the songs than Katy Perry had came out with, trying to deliver the same striking vibe that Gwen had shown. Hopefully, Gwen can come out with other song a bit better than this one was. This one doesn't lie, but could use a bit more to the heart.

But even given that, this is a decent collection of songs that, to my ears, mostly pay tribute to Harris' roots in Uriah Heep/UFO British hard rock of the early/mid 1970s. To be fair, I wouldn't have given this more than one listen if it weren't Steve Harris, but since it is him, and I did, I would say if you are a Maiden or Harris fan, and go in with realistic expectations, you'll find a decent album with some good hard rock songs on it. It's NOT great, and hopefully if Harris continues to do music outside of Maiden he'll go in different direction next time. It's basically a tribute to his earliest influences. Take that for what it's worth!","First off , I agree with the most common complaints here , that 1 ) the production is rather weak , and 2 ) the singer is pretty poor . that , this is a decent collection of songs that , to my ears , mostly pay tribute to Harris ' roots in Uriah Heep / UFO British hard rock of the early / mid 1970s .
