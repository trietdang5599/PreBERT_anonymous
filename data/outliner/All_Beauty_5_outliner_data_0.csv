A2MOJFGIAPOQQ3,B000URXP6E,-1,1,5,"I've had scalp issues my entire life and this is the only brand that not only didn't cause problems but cleared up problems I've had since I was a kid. I can remember my grandpa playing with my hair when I was eight and then going ""Good grief, her scalp is one giant scab!"" but since I've started using Nature's Gate I barely even have dandruff, much less scabs. I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo.","I have had scalp issues my entire life because problems but cleared up problems I have had since I was a kid .

Strangely, it's LESS moisturizing than their younger line. I'm still using it but next order will be back to their younger line of skincare.

I think the essence in this package is better but the overnight cream and moisturizer in the other package is much better.

I do not use their eye cream, though.

A2UOHALGF2X77Q,B000PKKAGO,1,-1,2,"I've been using Norelco rotary shavers for the last 20+ years. I've always found them to work well and be fairly comfortable. After a few years use, instead of replacing the heads and/or battery again, I pick up the latest top of the line Norelco that's available. The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved. It just gives a mediocre, uncomfortable shave. I've since returned it, and ordered new heads for my older Norelco. I would seriously think twice before spending $200 on this product.","I have always found them to work well and be fairly comfortable .

I've been using this for over two months. Before I started I couldn't even get my lashes on a curler. They were that short. Within two and a half weeks I could see a difference. Within a month I could get my lashes on a curler.

This product did make my eyelids itchy. No irritation in my eye though when I accidentally got some in it.  I also noticed a weird looking line above my lahses that is lighter than the rest of my skin.

I've used this as directed.  I did see improvement but I think there is a natural plateau to the lenght and amount of eyelashes that one's DNA will allow. I've hit mine.

A39WWMBA0299ZF,B0010ZBORW,1,-1,2,"Note: The company has several products linked together which can lead to a misleading / confusing time reading reviews. This is for the booties.

I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.

Sadly, I cannot recommend these booties. I would suggest getting a really comfortable pair of socks and using them for the same thing. You can probably find them cheaper and they will work just as well.","which can lead to a misleading / confusing time reading reviews . I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties .

Because this isn't a foaming product, you do have to use more than you would with some competing products.  I found it non-irritating, too.  (You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the main product page.)

This does have a strong smell.  I kind of like it, but I have heard from plenty of people who detest the scent.  It's an artificial blueberry sort of scent.  So if you have reactions to strong fragrances, you may want to stay away.","As a shaving cream , this performs well .

A28N2AWOVO2PB,B000PKKAGO,-1,1,5,"I used to wonder what caused redness and skin irritation every time I shaved. When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream, then I changed my shaving blades, then I tried changing my aftershave, but nothing helped. Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back.

I think I finally found the answer after I started using the new Philips Norelco drive-shave system. First, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so that I can get the job done.  Next, let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave. The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.

If I could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave. A great gift idea.","I used to wonder what caused redness and skin irritation every time I shaved .

A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B00N2WQ2IW,-1,1,4,"Since a conditioner affects your hair differently based on its unique qualities, I will first state that my hair is very long, thick, wavy, soft, and aging (I'm 50). It is not color treated. I have some flyaway hair and split ends, but nothing too overwhelming. My main concerns are shine enhancement/retention, ease of combing out, and body retention. My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.

This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning. It's creamy and thick so you don't need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair. While this didn't do too much to enhance shine, it didn't dull what I already had. I found that it smoothed hair a little less (some ""frizzy"" parts) than some conditioners in the lower portions (despite my attention to even distribution) and did a better job smoothing the top. It did not suppress the natural waves my hair has or weigh it down.

All in all, I think this is a pretty good conditioner, but it may work better for someone with younger hair who doesn't need so much in the way of shine enhancement.","that my hair is very long , thick , wavy , soft , and split ends , but nothing too overwhelming .

I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&guy plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.

The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too, so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine.

While Essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

First off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

Application will require 3 even light coats of this shade, followed by its top coat.  Let dry thoroughly between.  Not quite the gel shine tho.

This color is pale, which could account for results.

This polish will hold up well for two or three days if nails are protected somewhat. It will show signs of wear and small chipping at nail tips.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!","I have always prided myself on my good teeth . and brushing was enough ... That scared the hell out of me .

The next day, I put cold water in there and swished it around.  It was still sensitive, but I didn't have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  I think with continued use, this can dramatically minimize the sensitivity.

The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, and there weren't any instructions.  You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  You have to peel that part off, but it doesn't come off easily.  It is a little tricky to do.  I didn't notice a taste.  You aren't supposed to eat or drink for 30 minutes after you use them and you only leave them on for 10 minutes.

Well, it does have sandpaper sides, one of which would remove the face off a statue and other that buffs your flesh to a tender red. But other than that it's just sort of a sponge.

Couple of things to keep in mind - each strip is very small and will cover 1 or 2 teeth each.

Because this isn't a foaming product, you do have to use more than you would with some competing products.  I found it non-irritating, too.  (You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the main product page.)

This does have a strong smell.  I kind of like it, but I have heard from plenty of people who detest the scent.  It's an artificial blueberry sort of scent.  So if you have reactions to strong fragrances, you may want to stay away.","As a shaving cream , this performs well .

AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B001E96LUO,-1,1,4,"Finally seeing results.  But don't get the wrong idea.  This result-delay is probably not a CLEAN & CLEAR problem.  For some reason our teen boy thought he should use this cleanser  without a washcloth... AND apparently a washcloth is an extremely important part of getting the upper hand on breakouts.

The Backstory
Our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (Somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  This shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  We got this Clean & Clear Cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  After a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

We've since CANCELLED that appointment because I happened to watch boy wash his face one night. No Wash Cloth.  I smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  Apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  It's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. That the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  I suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

SUMMING IT  UP
This is working for us.  If you've got  younger teen using it, I highly recommend making sure that they know what they should be doing.  Don't assume they read the directions, even if they read everything else that crosses their path.

No irritation, easy to use, and the salicylic acid is working to make considerable changes in his complexion.","But do not get the wrong idea .

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy.

The recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and I've never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  Rinse thoroughly after use and tap to get the water out, that should be enough in my opinion.  As the ""biologist"" stated in his review, this seems a bit like overkill.

The soft mesh are a dime a dozen at any wal-mart and the rough side does the exact job a hand towel can do.  Putting them together... good marketing, not a great idea.  You can get the mesh and a hand towel for a fraction of what this sells for.

The biggest problem with putting them together is that when one side wears out you must replace them both.  A hand towel lasts forever and you don't need to replace it when the mesh wears down, unless you own this product.

So, I'm using my last one.  I see no reason to get more of these.  Just pick up your own and save the cash.","It does do what it promises but it falls short on innovation .

A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00DY59MB6,1,-1,3,"Crest Pro-Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing, alcohol-free mouth washes.  It has a pleasant minty flavor.

The active ingredient is 0.07%  cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic.  Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treat gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time.  However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems.  Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.

I also prefer a stronger, more astringent mouthwash with fluoride.

I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks.

A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00DY59MB6,1,-1,3,"Crest Pro-Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing, alcohol-free mouth washes.  It has a pleasant minty flavor.

The active ingredient is 0.07%  cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic.  Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treating gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time.  However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems.  Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.

I also prefer a stronger, more astringent mouthwash with fluoride.

So while I would recommend this mouthwash for people with gingivitis, I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use for people with healthy teeth and gums.","Crest Pro - Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing , alcohol - free mouth washes .

AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B001E96LUO,-1,1,4,"Finally seeing results.  But don't get the wrong idea.  This result-delay is probably not a CLEAN & CLEAR problem.  For some reason our teen boy thought he should use this cleanser  without a washcloth... AND apparently a washcloth is an extremely important part of getting the upper hand on breakouts.

The Backstory
Our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (Somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  This shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  We got this Clean & Clear Cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  After a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

We've since CANCELLED that appointment because I happened to watch boy wash his face one night. No Wash Cloth.  I smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  Apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  It's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. That the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  I suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

SUMMING IT  UP
This is working for us.  If you've got  younger teen using it, I highly recommend making sure that they know what they should be doing.  Don't assume they read the directions, even if they read everything else that crosses their path.

No irritation, easy to use, and the salicylic acid is working to make considerable changes in his complexion.","But do not get the wrong idea .

There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.

Because this isn't a foaming product, you do have to use more than you would with some competing products.  I found it non-irritating, too.  (You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the main product page.)

When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream, then I changed my shaving blades, then I tried changing my aftershave, but nothing helped. Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back.

I think I finally found the answer after I started using the new Philips Norelco drive-shave system. First, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so that I can get the job done.  Next, let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave. The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.

If I could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy.

After a few years use, instead of replacing the heads and/or battery again, I pick up the latest top of the line Norelco that's available. The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved. It just gives a mediocre, uncomfortable shave. I've since returned it, and ordered new heads for my older Norelco. I would seriously think twice before spending $200 on this product.","I have always found them to work well and be fairly comfortable .

I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&guy plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.

The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too, so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.

The biggest problem with putting them together is that when one side wears out you must replace them both.  A hand towel lasts forever and you don't need to replace it when the mesh wears down, unless you own this product.

The next day, I put cold water in there and swished it around.  It was still sensitive, but I didn't have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  I think with continued use, this can dramatically minimize the sensitivity.

The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, and there weren't any instructions.  You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  You have to peel that part off, but it doesn't come off easily.  It is a little tricky to do.  I didn't notice a taste.  You aren't supposed to eat or drink for 30 minutes after you use them and you only leave them on for 10 minutes.

A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00DY59MB6,1,-1,3,"Crest Pro-Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing, alcohol-free mouth washes.  It has a pleasant minty flavor.

The active ingredient is 0.07%  cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic.  Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treating gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time.  However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems.  Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.

I also prefer a stronger, more astringent mouthwash with fluoride.

So while I would recommend this mouthwash for people with gingivitis, I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use for people with healthy teeth and gums.","Crest Pro - Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing , alcohol - free mouth washes .

While Essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

First off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

Application will require 3 even light coats of this shade, followed by its top coat.  Let dry thoroughly between.  Not quite the gel shine tho.

This color is pale, which could account for results.

This polish will hold up well for two or three days if nails are protected somewhat. It will show signs of wear and small chipping at nail tips.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy.

My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.

This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning. It's creamy and thick so you don't need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair. While this didn't do too much to enhance shine, it didn't dull what I already had. I found that it smoothed hair a little less (some ""frizzy"" parts) than some conditioners in the lower portions (despite my attention to even distribution) and did a better job smoothing the top.
