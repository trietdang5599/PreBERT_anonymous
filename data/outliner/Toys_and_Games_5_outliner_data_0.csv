A1TF2HW3RB4895,B0098MTEDU,-1,1,5,"Its power and toughness are equal to the number of creatures you control. Note that it's not on your side of the field; anybody trying to swipe your monsters won't bring its beat-status down. So build up a field, whether keen tokens or speedy cheap drops, and beef it up.

Whenever it hits a player for combat damage, it populates. (If you don't know what populate means, it lists it on this card.)
That's great for building up any tokens you've made, especially since you have token options in every color! So besides just doing a populate on something in Selesnya (8/8 GW vigilant Elemental tokens from ""Grove of the Guardian"" 's ability, for example), you can do that with Vraska's black Assassin tokens in Standard, or any token allies from the Zendikar block (blue/white in the case of a friend of mine) in Modern. Bant decks, Naya decks, any multi-color shenanigans that have some focus on creature-based damage.

Note too that it says when it deals combat damage to a ""player"", not ""opponent"". This means if you have some creative way of hitting yourself and not regretting it (or just get its damage redirected to your face instead of their's), you still populate.

It's a wonderful beater later-game for three anyways, whether you populate with it or not. But with that ability, why wouldn't you?","and toughness are equal to the number of creatures you control . that it is not on your side of the field ; anybody trying to swipe your monsters will not bring its beat - status down .

No doubt to the quality and when you look at the ingredients, they basically take ducks and grind them up because there ain't much in here it but duck.  If I were buying it, I would consider for one of two things.  The first would be for training treats.  The second would be for the zombie apocalypse as it is basically freeze-dried dog food.  The bag only shows a one year shelf life, but freeze dried material is usually a much longer life.  I think if you emptied this into a vacuum packed bag, ten years would be nominal.  We are ""semi-preppers"" so having our dog's food taken care of would be an added plus.","I got this on a free trial . when I stop giving it to them , No doubt to the quality and grind them up The second would be for the zombie apocalypse as it is basically freeze - dried dog food . but freeze dried material is usually a much longer life .

It's a little tedious to put it together at first, but mainly because a few extra stickers, parts, etc were in the package that weren't needed for making the balloon (so I got confused). I also bought my helium tank from Party Supplies due to the negative reviews on the Toys R Us tank. I believe there is maybe one more fill left in the little tank ($50 for 2 fills is kind of lame) but it worked as desired. Ultimately, I would take this balloon to get it filled FOR YOU vs buying a tank...it can't be more than $5. As far as the finished product, I loved it. My 5 year old son loved it, too, even though he stopped playing with it after a week.

A2VXJ7T9N0L9DA,B00XUYWU9C,1,-1,2,"My boys LOVE legos, and overall my son was pleased with this set, which he used his own money to buy. The reasons for the lower rating is that the instructions are not included for the dragon. There are several different ways that you can build it, but NONE of them are included. You must look them up online and download them, which is very inconvenient and unexpected. One of the things I have appreciated about the LEGO brand is that building instructions are always included in the box. Not everyone has access to the internet to download instructions.

Furthermore, to add insult to injury, there were instructions included for the Lloyd figure. As my 7 year old said, ""I KNOW how to build a guy! It's just like all the others. Why did they put instructions for that and not the dragon which I've never built before?"" It's a good question. We have finally found the instructions, but it was still disappointing. I can understand having some be only available online, but I still think you should include the instructions for at least one of them in the box so that children can enjoy it immediately.","My boys LOVE legos , and overall my son was pleased with this set , The reasons for the lower rating is which is very inconvenient and unexpected .

A5GH0YNIDP48P,B000P6Q7MY,-1,1,4,"From the eyes of a preschooler, the most exciting part of playing with this Shrinky Dinks kit was to watch the charms curl up and then shrink in the oven.  For the flower pieces, it literally looked like the flower curled up and then opened!  Very fun to watch them in the oven.  My only concern is that you cannot do more than a couple at a time because due to the various sizes of each piece, some bake faster than others.  If you leave them all in the oven for the same amount of time, those ones that cooked faster will crack!  And because it takes time to do a couple at a time and then coloring takes time, we ended up having the oven ON all afternoon at 325F.  I think daddy thought that this was an $$ activity from an energy usage perspective.  From mommy's perspective, it was a lot of fun.  Much less work that I expected.  I just had to help with the baking process.  My little one managed to color them all by herself.  At first, she hesitated because the pieces are kinda small for her tiny fingers to hold down in place when coloring.  She needed a little bit of help to so do at the beginning and then she realized that the coloring does not have to be perfect within the lines yet the charms turn out beautiful.  Then, she just relaxed and color away.  I had some concern about 'sealing' the charms afterward because I thought the color may come off but so far so good.  Not needed.  Overall, I would recommend this activity kit for preschoolers and up who is looking for a new medium to express their arty side.","From the eyes of a preschooler , the most exciting part of playing with this Shrinky Dinks kit was to watch the charms curl up For the flower pieces , it literally looked like the flower curled up Very fun to watch them in the oven .

A2PLWER3W9YC4S,B002IVFOC8,-1,1,5,"After enjoying the MCX so much, I wasn't sure if I should buy the MSR, the CP Pro, or jump straight to the Blade 400, which will be my next heli. I almost went with a CP Pro since the price is close but you get a good 6 channel radio with the CP. Thing is, you get a better 6 channel transmitter with the Blade 400, so the MSR BNF still seemed like the most cost effective stepping stone.

At first, I thought I made a mistake because the MSR was much more unpredictable than the MCX, and I thought the problem was partly the imprecise basic transmitter. But after some practice, most of the the unpredictability was due to me learning single-rotor flight characteristics. The basic radio is definitely too vague and clunky for the MSR, but it is adequate.

I find the MSR a little frustrating because it can (and often does) go way too fast for indoors, but at a mere 0.8 ounces plus 0.2 for the battery, any wind blows it away. It's a great little performer without a reliable venue.

Great: Maneuverability, speed, overall durability, single rotor, sounds angry, extra tail rotor and mixing flybar, comes with two batteries (uses one at a time) and a great 4-battery charger with a wall plug.

Frustrating: Unstable in a light wind, too sporty for the basic transmitter (precision control is much better in the low rate mode, but then it lacks the control throw to move any faster than an MCX), flight time per battery is shorter than the MCX even with the 120mAh battery.

The MSR's surprising, MCX-like durability was definitely the best reason to choose it as an intro to single rotor flying.","After enjoying the MCX so much , I was not sure if I should buy the MSR , the CP Pro , or jump straight to the Blade 400 , but you get a good 6 channel radio with the CP .

3.  the box doesn't show the entire puzzle.  A good inch on one side is missing on the box, and about the same is added on the other side--and that is not showing on the box either.

A2H44WVZS59KKT,B017DPFROS,-1,1,4,"This is a Velocity Toys Baja off-road truck. It is 1:10 scale, 15.5"" x 9.5"" x 6.5"". The body is lightweight and is removable. The car has a working suspension front and rear. The tires are soft and have a knobby tread and get good traction. It's fun to drive and has good power.

It uses a 7.4V battery that's really two 3.7V batteries put together. It uses a USB charger that has an indicator that changes from red to green when it's done charging. The remote has a steering wheel and a trigger and uses four AA batteries (that are not included).

The only thing about it that I thought could be better is the steering. It doesn't turn very sharply and sometimes it takes a couple of tries to get around the corner. Now that I'm more practiced I can get it around a sharp corner if I accelerate and spin the rear tires.

This would be a good choice for younger kids as it isn't overly fast and could be driven around inside on a rainy day if you have room.

AXUJFOFQZNTN,B00JXKQWU0,1,-1,3,"My son and I first heard of Little Bits at a local Makers Fair.  One of the tables was run by a self-described Little Bits Evangelist and he had several interesting projects he created with these things.  We left the Fair intrigued by these products.

Son is very interested in electronics.  We had him set up with numerous Snap Circuits kits as well as other DIY project kits.  He's comfortable putting together interesting circuit designs.  This did seem like a natural fit for him...looking like it's part LEGO, part electronics, all fun.  And indeed, with this set he did do some interesting projects that were included with the kit.  He had a lot of fun designing his own satellite dish and understanding how parabolas work (for context, he's a precocious 11).

All in all, it does seem like a very open ended continuation of learning about circuits.  My kid can build certain circuits from scratch, but now with Little Bits he takes pre-made circuits and puts them all together into larger projects.  However, my complaint is twofold...

First, the target audience seems unclear to me.  The LEGO-like nature of this product along with the kid-friendly instructions for the projects make me think this is something aimed at older pre-teen kids, but the actual use of them seems to imply an even older audience.  Not that I don't think a product should push the envelope for kids - it should.  But there do seem to be a limited number of modules in this kit which seems to have an inherent limit as to what you can make with it.

Which leads me to my second criticism.  If this is aimed as a learning tool/product for kids, well, the price point is kind of up there.  This product seems to give a limited number of modules which cannot really be combined in all possible combinations, at a price that makes it risky to purchase for a kid who may exhaust the potential of the kit relatively quickly.  Certainly one can buy other kits, or even other modules ala carte, but those aren't inexpensive either.  I think the price point really does limit the willingness of a parent to take a chance on this.

Reviewing the Little Bits website, I see that Little Bits are also used by some adults to create demonstration prototypes (for, say, a startup company), and that it seems to me is its strongest market niche.  Adults with a strong background in design would certainly find it easy and convenient to have a supply of ready-made snap-together circuits to create something.  I'm just not sure if kids are really going to get lasting value out of Little Bits without a large (and, frankly, expensive) inventory of modules.

Overall I do appreciate the concept and I think the innovation of small pre-built snap-together circuit modules is compelling.  I just wish the price point was set so as to make it accessible to more kids, if indeed kids are the target audience.","and I first heard of Little Bits at a local Makers Fair . and he had several interesting projects he created with these things . We left the Fair intrigued by these products . Son is very interested in electronics . We had him set up with numerous Snap Circuits kits as well as other DIY project kits . He is comfortable putting together interesting circuit designs . This did seem like a natural fit for him ... looking like it is part LEGO , part electronics , all fun . And indeed , with this set he did do some interesting projects He had a lot of fun designing his own satellite dish and understanding how parabolas work ( for context , he is a precocious 11 ) . All in all , it does seem like a very open ended continuation of learning about circuits . My kid can build certain circuits from scratch , However , my complaint is twofold ... First , the target audience seems unclear to me .

A2VYSW6T63JF2W,B00CKH9I1I,1,-1,3,"I got the Barbie Digital Makeover Mirror for my 9 year old daughter because she really wants to wear makeup but we think she's still too young. We thought this might be a way she could experiment with makeup without putting on real makeup.

Putting the mirror together was a snap, literally. The two pieces snap together very easily, and it's  a pretty sturdy stand for your iPad. The software downloaded quickly and the Bluetooth paired with the iPad easily. Then my daughter went through the ""setup"" on the app, and I don't know if she was just impatient and skipped over it really quickly or if the app was just buggy, but it took us a good 30 minutes to get it working from that point. It was starting to get really frustrating, but we finally started over, went through the whole setup, and everything seemed to work okay.

I will say, since this relies on the camera on the iPad, and we had an iPad 2 with a not-so-great front camera, we had to be in an area with pretty good amount of light for it to recognize her face. The little lights on around the iPad provide hardly any real light to light your face.

Once she got it working, she had a lot of fun playing with it. You can save photos to the iPad with your makeup, so you can share them with your friends, etc. Overall she really enjoyed playing with the mirror. I think this would be great for girls aged 5-8, my daughter (9) likes it, but probably not as much as younger girls would.","The two pieces snap together very easily , and it is   a pretty sturdy stand for your iPad . and the Bluetooth paired with the iPad easily . and I do not know if she was just impatient or if the app was just buggy , but it took us a good 30 minutes to get it working from It was starting to get really frustrating , and everything seemed to work okay . and we had an iPad 2 with a not - so - great front camera , we had to be in an area with pretty good amount of light for it to recognize her face .

AJRIBST4BQP94,B01D20ARXE,-1,1,4,"Overall this is a good toy. My only concern is that my kids don't play with it for long at a time, but they do come back to it. I got this for my 1 year old to start walking with and my 3.5 year old keeps playing with it too. My 1 year old is just starting to walk and a little unsteady so she likes to hold on to anything near by. I figured this would be good for her, she could push it around and be a little more stable. That works great! She loves walking around with it, but gets bored quickly and moves on to something else. Let's look closer:

Pros:
*Versatility. You can leave the  back wheels off completely and lay it on the ground, or connect them as a walker or a ride on. Once that is done you can lock the back wheels to keep them still or unlock to allow it to roll around. I have used it all of these ways and found uses in each case.
*Easy to switch. FINALLY!!!! A toy that goes from one mode to another without making you scream! There are two large plastic screws in the back of the legs that easily unscrew to move them together or apart depending on which mode you want.
*Off switch. A TRUE off switch, not one of those ""auto off"" things that still makes noise if you sneeze too hard. It goes completely off if you want it to.
*Volume control. Soft is very soft and I can completely tune it out, and loud is loud enough to not ignore but not too loud to be annoying over time.
*Amount of things to do. There are a bunch of buttons to press, things to turn, etc. Everything triggers noises or lights or both so there is instant feedback for your child. The wheel and horn are a favorite in this house and it makes the music start so they love it.

Cons:
*Screws. OK, so it does easily go from one mode to another, but there are other screws in the initial assembly that are simply terrible! They are such a soft metal that they start to strip out as you are putting it together. I have assembled TONS of products over the years and am that person friends call over to do stuff like that for them. I know how to pick the right screwdriver for the job, and that didn't help. The amount of force needed for that handle on the top almost ensures the screws will strip out on you. I even tried one with the power tools on the lowest setting and same issue.
*Weight limit. There is a weight limit for the kids to ride on it. My 3.5 year old is just over it so I am constantly telling her to get off it. I can see it start to sag a little big when she is on it. I don't think it would break, but I am not willing to take the risk anyway.
*Bored quickly. While both of my kids keep coming back this thing, hence the 4 stars, they are also just as quickly leaving it alone. I wish it had more of a interactive game mode to keep them over there playing with it.

I would recommend it as there are plenty of pros and my kids do keep playing with it, but keep in mind that they probably won't play with it long and there is a weight limit so the toy will become obsolete after a time. I am not sure why, but my 1 year old keeps trying to crawl under the thing and then gets stuck. I wonder if anybody else has kids that do that? I wonder why? Anyway, It's the quality you would expect from VTech and pretty easy to assemble even with the bad screws. It doesn't take up that much space in the house, so it's worth a try in my opinion.","Overall this is a good toy .

He couldn't wait to get it out of the box (not impossible but he needed help) and start playing. Since we have no other members of the Avengers team, it was a little hard to come up with long-term playtime ideas. My nephew really enjoyed the speech and sound effects. The button on Captain America's chest is easy to use and he says about 12 different lines. They seem to come up randomly, but that doesn't seem to matter. His arms, legs and head move, too. Except for the shield, all parts are attached. For example, the utility belt can't be removed.

To really make this fun, it would be best to have more members of the Avengers team. The box says the Avengers interact with Hulk Buster, but I'm not sure how that works since that would be another $43.

This is recommended for children four and over; however, the only thing that could cause a choking hazard is the head, but it would be difficult to remove -- I guess it could happen, though.

One of the planes was glued to the paper packaging. There was no way to not rip the plane, so right away one was broken.
One of the planes did not come with enough pieces to assemble it, so its just extra parts I guess.
Now as you can see I am down to ten planes instead of twelve. I also want to add I did not get an assortment as the photo shows, I only got two styles of planes.

A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B00GTCKOCM,-1,1,5,"This is a cute toy, although the bone leash seems a bit short. I originally thought the bone was to use like you would with an xylophone, but then once I received it and red over the paperwork inside, i realized it was actually a leash to lead the dog and walk with him. The nice part about it being short though, is that for babies who aren't walking yet, it is short enough that they can sit and pull the bone and still trail the dog around them, whereas if the string were longer, it would be too much length for their little arms and they wouldn't be able to pull the dog ... theyd just be pulling string since they'd lack reach.

Each colored key is easy to push, even for tiny baby/toddler hands. It says the letters, along with an object that starts with the letter and a corresponding phrase. He says a lot of other random phrases as well, which entice interaction with him.

The sound and tone are not too loud or annoying and with an entire alphabet of phrases/letters, you won't hear the same thing over and over - there is a little variation there, at least.

It's a colorful, fun toy and seems pretty solid so as not to have to worry about it getting damaged or broken.","This is a cute toy , I originally thought the bone was to use like you would with an xylophone , and red over the paperwork inside , i realized it was actually a leash to lead the dog The nice part about it being short though , is yet , it is short enough they would just be pulling string since they would lack reach .

ALUZO8SLEA7S4,B00JBXAYTE,1,-1,3,"Grandma gave this board game to my kiddos because she's aware of their Paw Patrol obsession.  While the game is OK, it seems to be missing something...especially in the clarity of the directions.

It comes with cardboard game pieces, one of each of the 6 main pups.  There are several cardboard badges for each pup.  There's also a cardboard spinner, as well as the game board.

The premise is simple enough, though I do agree the directions aren't the most clear.  You spin the arrow and move to the corresponding color.  You collect the pup badge for whatever color you landed on (once you have a red, you don't get another one next time you're on red).  If you pass over a ladder shortcut, you take the shortcut if you've already collected that pup's badge.  If you haven't, no shortcut.  The one exception is your pup's ladder (your playing piece).  You take his or her ladder whether you've collected the badge or not. Whoever gets to the end first wins.

This game is basically Candy Land mixed with Chutes and Ladders, but shorter and with Paw Patrol characters.  It's cute, and if your kiddo is super into Paw Patrol, it might be a good purchase.  Otherwise I'd say you can skip it and just go with Candy Land!","because she is aware of their Paw Patrol obsession .

The velcro on the skirt is heat bonded on. It won't hold up for a lot of wardrobe changings. The skirt is not well sewn. At all. It is unraveling already.

It assembled easily with the instructions and I don't think it took over 30 minutes to assemble.
You are able to use the other trackmaster trains (we have a Percy from the other set) on this set as well.
My 1.5 star ding is what I perceive for lack of long term play and lack of interactive play for the price of this set. There are two interactive items on this set: 1) your child can release a barrel for Thomas to push a short distance 2) you have to reset Harold for the trains to make their big jump. Although, it's exciting to see the trains being ""airlifted"" by Harold and jump a large distance, that's all your kids do, is watch the train go around the track.
As a parent, I'm slightly disappointed with the lack of interaction and imaginative play with the Trackmaster sets. We own a thomas train table with a lot of ads-ons. My son has spent countless hours playing with his wooden railway. He can design his own track and pick the pieces he wants to add and remove to play with. He carries on a monologue between the trains and their activities. There is no comparison between the wooden railways and the Tarckmaster sets.

A1OZA52DFY3SHD,B00THAGEJA,-1,1,4,"Scrabble Twist is a fun pass 'n' play electronic game that is great for 2-4 players.

Scrabble Twist has hard plastic wand design that fits comfortably in an adult's hands, but is simple enough to also be handled by a 7 year old.  The device takes 3 AA batteries, but you have to use a screwdriver to take the battery panel off.  There is no on/off switch, the device automatically goes to sleep if nothing is pressed for 30 seconds.  The wand itself is rather simple. There are five circular buttons on the face that have blue LED backlighting.  One red cap houses a speaker, and the other red cap can be twisted about 45 degrees in either direction.

To turn it the device, just twist the red cap.  A menu is illuminated on the five blue circles.  You use the twisting motion to cycle through the options, and hit any blue circle to select the displayed option.  If you flip the wand it recognizes the orientation and automatically turns the letters right-side-up. There are three games to choose from:

SOLO:  5 random letters appear in the blue circles.  You must press the circles in order to spell 3 to 5 letter words, and then twist the cap to lock in your word.  If its a valid word, you get a friendly chime.  If its not a real word in the Scrabble dictionary, you get a bad noise and an X briefly pops up in each circle.  There is a third pop noise if you repeat a word.  You score 3 points for a 3-letter word, 5 for a 4-letter word, and 7 for a 5-letter word.  The game can be set for 45, or 60, or 75 seconds.  Once your time is up, your score is displayed on the blue circles.

TURBO:  Same as solo, except after your turn is up, your score is displayed and you pass the wand to the next player.  Each player gets the same 5 letters to work with. Once everyone is done, the wand tells you that P3, or whoever, was the winner.  You can set the wand for 2-8 players.

PARTY:  This is also for 2-8 players.  The same 5 letters are used throughout the game.  P1 starts and has to create a single 3 to 5 letter word and has 15 seconds to do so.  That person calls out the word as they twist to lock it in.  The wand is passed to the next player, who must create a valid word and pass the wand on.  If a player cannot form a new valid word within the time limit, they are knocked out.  The game ends when one member is left.

In the master menu settings, you can adjust the games from Easy to Medium to Hard.  The changes basically alter the amount of time you get for each game.  The default setting of Medium grants each player 60 seconds in SOLO or TURBO time.  Its probably the best balanced time allotment for most players.

Overall, the game is a lot of fun for people of all ages.  I just have a few small complaints.  First, there is no option to save your high scores in SOLO mode in order to compete with yourself over time.  My second complaint is that the volume levels are difficult to control.  There are 4 volume settings buried in the main menu: Low, Med, High, Mute.  Playing the game on mute is a major challenge because the only way you know you are running out of time is to listen to the ticking noise that continuously speeds up for the last 15 seconds of a round.  If you set the volume to Low, its still pretty loud for quieter environments.  I brought it to the office one day to show my co-workers and we couldn't play a game because even on the low setting it was loud and distracting to nearby workers.  I would have liked to have seen an extra low volume setting for this purpose.  Also, I appreciate the smooth, clean design that does not include switches or buttons beyond the 5 circle letter buttons, but I would have liked to have seen a physical volume dial on the device.  If you have a game going and the phone rings, the game has to just cycle all the way to the end with the loud ticking clock noise before it can shut off.  This can produce 30 loud, embarrassing seconds you have to deal with.  Finally, hitting the blue circle buttons isn't that bad, but it does take some physical pressure to get your inputs to register.  For an adult its not really a problem, but for an 8 year old with small hands, it can become a frustrating limitation preventing them from achieving a very high score.

Even with those complaints, though, Im only knocking Scrabble Twist down one star.  Its a fun, inexpensive game that is great for parties when people have short attention spans.  When you are playing with 2-4 people, they only have to wait 60 seconds per person before they get a shot and everyone stays involved.  If you play with 8 people, the last person has to wait 8-10 minutes and may wander off before their turn comes around.  If you keep that in mind, though, I think youll be happy with your Scrabble Twist purchase.","Scrabble Twist is a fun pass ' n ' play electronic game that is great for 2 - 4 players .

A14ANXXFV8JUWY,B019FBGSQ4,1,-1,2,"It's a full featured play kitchen that makes good use of the space it occupies and has proven engaging for my daughter to play with. From washing her plush dolls in the washing machine to general cooking and baking cookies. That's the good part.

Assembly takes a long time and will test your patience for peeping at too small pictures and tolerance for defects along the way. Some of the assembly pictures were incorrect and I found it helpful to download the PDF from the manufacturer's website so I could zoom in on certain assembly steps.

The box was delivered by UPS intact but the styrofoam was broken all over the place inside, carry on we thought and found more scuffs and scratches the minute we unpacked the box; most of them were on back edges or sides that would be inside facing so we decided to continue with assembly. But the main counter piece literally had a glob of color matched ""glue"" on the outer edge to fill a defect, it was sticky and off color once you take a closer look at it.

By this point, we're already 70% done so one must decide to accept and continue, call kidkraft to get replacements and leave a 70% finished kitchen just hanging around, or breakdown pack up and return the whole thing. Not a decision you want to make 2 hours into assembly at 10 PM at night. Up our tolerance for defects it went; repeating our mantra that kids will beat the thing up eventually anyways.

Another hour or so later and we were done! Two days later, an inside piece of the oven knob or range snaps off when my 4 year old was playing with it. Luckily, nothing fell out of place and it doesn't seem to affect the set but one must wonder and question how well this will last over the years of repeated play.

In summary; good design and play features but assembly could have been better thought out, packaging was deficient for parcel delivery, sloppy QA on pieces, and overall questionable material quality.","It is a full featured play kitchen that makes good use of the space it occupies and has proven engaging for my daughter to play with .

The jaw is still hinged, but it will not stay open. It feels almost like there is a spring that makes it immediately shut.

(I bought the new puppy bonez this year as well and his legs were done the same way). I guess this is a way for the company to save money.

Our kids absolutely love this gun! It fits in their hands (4 year old and 7 year old) perfectly. The rubber ""bullet"" shoots out with a loud sound that makes each shot exciting. It shoots about 12 inches tethered by a string, so that they can target practice and shoot their stuffed animals. It doesn't hurt if they accidentally get shot, because the tip of the bullet has a soft foam tip.

Yet the only thing that keeps this from being a perfect 5-star item is that the bullet gets stuck with too much regularity (like 25% of the time). When this happens, you have to manually remove the bullet and replace it. It's not horrible, but it does impede play and regularly require adult intervention.

A1Z2WZU64RFCFU,B00T2DFITY,-1,1,5,"First off, let's get the most important part out of the way:  THIS IS THE BASE BLASTER.  NO MAGAZINES/CLIPS, NO DARTS, NO STOCK, NO BARREL, AND NO BATTERIES.  ALL SOLD SEPARATELY.

With that out of the way, the blaster itself is fairly decent.  It's a semi-auto, clip-fed blaster; firing 1 round with each trigger pull.  More or less a Stryfe with more rail attachment points.

It is notably front-heavy, as the battery case is in the gray foregrip, with the motors above that, and having a much longer front-end compared to a Stryfe, making it harder to single-wield if you don't have the arm strength.  Moreso if you kit it out with accessories and a barrel (or two, if using barrels that allow another barrel to be attached).

It is compatible with almost every detachable Nerf stock, Nerf barrel, Nerf rail, and Nerf clip accessory, from the old Raider stock and Longstrike barrel to the Firefly dart magazine or Raider 35-round drum.  However, the only darts it can fire are the new Elite darts (and similar Chinese copies).  Older dart head types will not work in the clip or with the motors (suction darts get stuck in the rubber passthrough inside the gun).

Rapid fire is not recommended; as you do need to allow the motors to reach full rev again after each shot; otherwise, it'll quickly cut down the ranges of additional fired darts.  Fortunately, this doesn't take long.  Initial revv'ing up does take a few seconds though.

There is one notable issue with the blaster itself; scopes are practically useless on this blaster; the top rail is too high and the forward top rail is blocked by the carrying handle in the back.

Why I gave it 5 stars:  Because it's the base blaster, which is all I needed.  I already have plenty of Nerf accessories I can use or reuse with this blaster, many of them as good as, if not better than, the Modulus remakes, and it's cost-competitive (as a Prime member) and more common than old Stryfes (hard to find on local shelves and often about the same price after shipping costs).  Not to mention, it performs better than a basic and unmodded Stryfe despite a few setbacks (mainly weight and scope use).

This definitely isn't the blaster version to buy if you're looking for a brand new blaster as a gift; you would be better served getting the Modulus starter pack and just buy a set of batteries.  Lithium AAs work well if you want a bit more kick than regular AAs.

He opened the package by himself (which was a HUGE help!) and started working on it right away. I noticed he bypassed the instructions and went right in to playing. He set up the blocks, used the slingshot to fie the birds toward the pigs and the structure he built. He must have did this for a good 30 minutes.

When I finally came over and read the directions, we attempted to play the game. I explained it step by step to him but he wasn't having it. He didn't care to compete, it was more fun to just play.

We kept the pieces, ditched the cards for maybe when he is older and for now, he just plays with the parts like he does on the screen.","and was very excited .

AJNW2SVETWAW1,B00TYUFCMI,1,-1,3,"Just to be clear, right from outset  the title of this game says it all!  You definitely need to be a Movie Buff to play this, and you need to be really good at remembering actors, their roles, and specific quotes from the movies.  I love movies, so I figured I would love this game.  But Im not all that great at coming up with names and quotes on my own.

Heres how this game works:  Everyone is dealt 10 cards from a huge pile of cards.  Most of the cards read, Movie, Actor, Role, or Quote.  The player going first can play any one of these four, and then name the movie, actor, role, or quote they're referencing.  The next player then plays off on the actor or film, adding another actor, role, or quote.  This goes on until the players cant think of anything else to add, or until someone plays one of the Strategy Cards, which allow you to switch things up.  For example, if I started with a Movie card and named the film War of the Worlds, and then the second player put down an Actor card and named Tom Cruise, the third player could put down a Reverse Angle strategy card, which would allow him to take the game in another direction.  This player could then play another Movie card and name the film, Mission Impossible, which means the play switches to this new film (also starring Tom Cruise).  The object of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand  the first one to do so wins.

Its really not hard at all to get the hang of playing this.  What IS hard is coming up with actors and character names and direct quotes (unless thats your thing).  Had this game included a Director card, I might have had more luck (for some reason I remember directors more than I do actors and their character names).

This can be a fun game  and you can adjust the rules to fit the people playing.  But its a little pricey for a box of cards that contain no information on them at all.  This is not a trivia game, even though thats how its being marketed.  There are no questions and no answers.  Its up to the players to come up with everything (and up to the players to determine whether the names and titles and quotes are correct!).

Bottom line, this is pretty much a game that works or not depending on whos playing.  And you could probably play it on your own, without any cards at all.  Would I pay $25 for this set of cards?  No, I would not.  The box is cute, though!","Just to be clear , right from outset   the title of this game says it all !

1.  Use an air mattress pump.  Even an athlete on a bicycle pump will take a long time.
2.  The hose connector comes with two pieces.  For a standard hose, you only need the circle and snap it over the intake (left side) and screw it on.
3.  You'll have to arrange the sides to make sure that the water sprinkles onto the slide.
4.  Since hose water can be a little cold, I used some Supersoakers filled with very warm water to keep the kids from freezing.

My kids were laughing a lot and going crazy with this slide.  I would say the fun factor was definitely there for them.  Since my backyard has a mild incline, the slide did bunch up and I periodically had to pull it back to full length for them.

Lasted one session.  I noticed a small 2 inch leak at the seam for the water pool mid-play.  At the end, the pool burst with a 2-3 foot gap... a little too big for the small repair patch included in the box.","and screw it on .

AT033BUEYOOKV,B0072URE3M,1,-1,3,"Awesome figure. Incredible sculpt, detailed paint work, and solid accessories.

One of the coolest things about this figure is his costume design. It's littered with question marks, with the main attraction actually being on the figure's back. There's a large, sculpted, yellow question mark, and it looks awesome. So much so that this is one figure you may actually consider displaying from the back. It really does look that cool.

Articulation isn't great though. His arms and head are fine. Very good actually. But past that it's pretty limited. The way the articulation is sculpted into the figure looks great, and he stands OK on his own, but only really in one leg position. A base helps if you really wanna pose this figure around.

His accessories are great. Only two of them but what's here is cool. I like the translucent cane, and the hat is removable. It falls off his head fairly easy though, but once posed it's likely not gonna go anywhere.

Overall a very cool Riddler figure, and the head sculpt (and sculpt all around) is really the main selling point here. Overall he just looks great. But don't expect to get a ton of articulation out of him. You can still get cool poses just because his arm articulation is really good, and there's fun stuff you can do with the cane if you get creative, but don't expect to get him to stand outside of a flat standing pose. At least not without a base.

EDIT: Hand broke off when trying to get the staff out of it, applying very little force. Dropped score to 3 stars from 5. Tired of broken figures!!!","Awesome figure .

We got a small hole around the main intake valve early on that was very hard to patch.  So, we made due as best we could, but it needed to be pumped up a little before each use, which was a bit of a hassle.  The hole was along a seam line, so it seamed like it could use a little work.  The kids loved it enough that we bought a second one on sale, for next season, and this one was tossed.  It sat too long at end of season with some rain water in it, and it was past the point we wanted to try bleaching it since we had the slow leak in it anyway.

Hopefully the seam hole was specific to the first one, and the kids have just as much fun next season without some of the deflation.","Kids absolutely loved it . not just playing it it , It was freaking out our toddler a bit at first , so we had to figure out the right amount of water pressure to pump in , to get the fountains to just spray up 2 to 3 feet , and then slowly increased them up . that was very hard to patch .

There are duplicates of the colors, but that isn't a bad thing in my case as a teacher. I actually wouldn't mind it for my personal use either. It just means I have backups.

My real issue with these pens is that most of them do not work. The ones that do, have pretty colors. However, 3 of the first 5 I tried did not work. My Husband and I tried pushing hard on the ends, swirling them around on different pieces of blank paper, and we even went so far as to take a lighter to the end of one of the pens and try to get the ink out.

A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J,B004KZ597A,-1,1,5,"This game is best for 3 to 4 year olds. It would help if an adult or a patient older sibling can help facilitate the gameplay. There are variations, but it's basically a way to practice taking turns while getting familiarized with colors and shapes. The bugaboos of the game are that the dice have a joker which allows you to pick any piece, and the white on the colored die means you have to skip your turn - it's important to learn skipping turns too.

It is fun to see a child react delightfully after getting the pieces, but kids 5 and up would be bored. Also, there are 40 pieces to pick up. That's at least 40 rolls total, so it can get long. Due to the simplicity of the game, maybe the gameboard should have contained smaller number of pieces to match a younger child's attention span.

The board itself is made of cardboard like those jigsaw puzzles contained within a cardboard frame and backing. I can see the board getting beaten up if not cared for. The game can be played by one like solitaire, but that's 40 dice roll for one child and can be a tough task to complete.

For at least 2 preschoolers, this is a fun game. I recommend minimal supervision, or you can join in the gameplay if you want.","This game is best for 3 to 4 year olds .

A3PSCL2RXFINQ0,B00HVV4CJ6,-1,1,4,"This is a nice little set of metal tank models.  But there are some quirks and annoyances.

The Chi-Ha and Tiger are well designed and come out great.  The T-34 however, has crappy inner wheel covers which rotate freely when assembled.  A drop of super glue on each will do the trick, but come on.  I shouldn't have to do that.  Also, the model looks cool, but it doesn't look like a T34.  I mean, it really doesn't look like one.  It comes out kind of angular looking like a German tank destroyer, or something much more modern with a low turret.

The Sharman has issues too.  The main body and wheels hit it on the dot.  Nice job.  The turret, however, is just Sherman- like.  I did figure out that if you bend the bottom tab outwards on the main gun mount, it'll sit more downwards vs. the instructions and photo which make it look like an artillery piece.  But still.. the turret is a miss.

Also, these are NOT in scale to each other.  The Sherman dwarfs all the other tanks, and the Chi-Ha would be a monster, not the little jungle tank that it is.

In order of difficulty (Hardest :1):
1.  Chi-Ha 2. Sherman (rounded angles on front of body are a pain) 3. Tiger  4. T34

ACEA95FQS1AVP,B00AW6XYLE,-1,1,4,"Confession time: I'm 37 and I have no children. I chose this Iron Man toy for me! I wanted a cool looking Iron Man Mark 42 from the film  to put in my DVD cabinet (after playing with it for a while, of course) and this popped up.  I was torn over what rating to give, 3 stars or 4.

Pros: I expect a young children under 8 would love this. He has several different voice messages, which include sound effects, that play when his chest button is pressed. Phrases such as ""Systems critical; Rebooting systems now; Scanning for possible threats,"" etc. His eyes also light up when the messages play. A separate button to fire the missiles is on the back of the figure, but these can also be fired manually by rotating the canon on the arm. It has a range of about 3 feet.  The figure looks impressive and considering it is not a collectible, it's very accurate to the film (except for the canon), with bold coloring.  It's also big - once the bottom of the legs are attached, he's 15 inches high.  The figure also has good balance. When you put the legs in the correct position, he will stand without being held.

Cons: However, considering the price, I am very disappointed that the figure has almost no articulation. The arms do not bend at the elbows or wrists, and the legs do not bend at the knee. Even the joints at the hip only go a few degrees.  He won't ""sit.""  The head does turn a bit from left to right, but that is all.  The figure is very much like one of the original Star Wars figures - completely straight limbs that have limited rotation.  Further, this is not frustration free packaging, and the lack of batteries mean he won't work right out of the box. Adults should consider this before gifting this to a child.

Overall, this is a nice toy and I would recommend it for little Iron Man fans (be they boys or girls). I'm just disappointed that the price of toys continues to rise and the value for the price does not. I don't think this is worth $35, but it is comparable to similar toys and in that light is worth the purchase.","Confession time : I am 37 and I have no children .

A3D7IM8TJUZJ5,B00B1RG2S0,-1,1,4,"My 6 year old was over the moon to get this.  He loves it.  He'll be too big for this soon and it was still worth the purchase.  I wanted to give it 3.5 stars but Amazon wouldn't let me.  Two reasons for 3.5 star rating: assembly is one.  It's easy enough but takes a long time and has really annoying directions (and I've done my fair share of Ikea assemblies).  The directions are pictures only.  You receive multiple lengths of screws and the pictures give you no clue as to which size you should use.  That's when you discover there is a smaller piece of paper that shows pictures of which size goes with which step of the directions.  But it's still picture based so you have to look at all of them to figure out if the picture is showing the biggest size screw or one that is a bit shorter.

The second reason is the chain drive - it's a mixed blessing.  The chain drive is awesome for giving this machine better driving than standard kiddy toys.  BUT it requires removing 8 screws and some serious finger gymnastics to get the chain reattached when it comes off.  And it will come off.",He loves it . and it was still worth the purchase . but Amazon would not let me .

AAH603Y3Y8QL7,B00176GOMO,-1,1,4,"I was so excited when I first saw this toy.  It looked like it came with quite a few of Manny's Tools and my son could actually take things apart and 'fix' them.  There are 9 different fixing activities: toaster, clock, camera, fan, radiator, engine, air filter, battery, and spark plug.  Most of the parts come completely off of the truck (not the engine or the spark plug).  Manny makes suggestions on what to fix, your child may receive a phone call from a client stating that their item is not working properly, or your child can choose.  The truck hood opens to fix the engine parts and the bed of the truck converts into Manny's Repair Shop.  This set comes with: Rusty (pipe wrench), Felipe (phillips head screwdriver), Squeeze (pliers), Dusty (saw), and a vise.  Once a project is completed, Manny congratulates the child on his/her accomplishment.

Here are the problems that I have discovered:  1. The wrench (Rusty) does not work very well.  You cannot move him in a circular motion given the tight spaces of the screws.  You need to constantly take him off and re-adjust.  Therefore, my son opts to use the pliers (Squeeze), but he is not coordinated enough at this age to do so. He becomes frustrated and wants me to fix the item.  2. The saw (Dusty) has no real purpose and is not interactive.  A piece of wood sits in the vice and you may freely saw the wood. No instruction is given and it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the toy. 3. Occasionally, Manny states (as he does in his show) to measure it twice and cut it once. However, this toy does not come with a tape measure. Not really sure what we are supposed to measure. It is just a random statement.  4. Where is Manny? There is a front seat that is large enough to store all the parts and still have room for a Manny doll. 5. The roof of the truck cab removes too easily.  My son tries to push the truck or lift it by the roof and it pops off. I am constantly having to put it back together.

Overall, my son (and husband) like this toy. We do not watch the show, but it is a unique toy for children who like to try and fix things on their own. I only gave it four stars primarily for the price. We purchased this toy from Target for $55 (less than listed on Amazon), but I still would expect a Manny doll to come with it for the price.","I was so excited It looked like it came with quite a few of Manny 's Tools There are 9 different fixing activities : toaster , clock , camera , fan , radiator , engine , air filter , battery , and spark plug . or the spark plug ) . that their item is not working properly , This set comes with : Rusty ( pipe wrench ) , Felipe ( phillips head screwdriver ) , Squeeze ( pliers ) , Dusty ( saw ) , Once a project is completed , Manny congratulates the child on his / her accomplishment .

This kit is more than building the robot, or 8 robots, as the case may be.  This toy also requires some programming to get the robot to do what you want it to do.  I found that infinitely more interesting than a lot of the Knex toys that are very difficult to put together and take apart.

I find it fascinating to watch our ten year-old work on these kits by Thames and Kosmos.

A2WUR8BFH27GXM,B01577D8MC,-1,1,5,"Great 1vs1 dueling game similar to Magic or Hearthstone.  What makes this game unique is being able to play any card from your deck instead of having to draw.  Combat is done with dice which I enjoy.
The rules are very simple and easier to learn than any other game of this genre IMO.
What can be confusing is the difference between Mage Wars, Mage Wars Arena, and this game - Mage Wars Academy.
Mage Wars and MWArena are, for the most part, the same game.  Arena is the ""rebranding"" of the original Mage Wars which uses a board and a more tactical and complicated game in that there are a few more rules and strategies to take into consideration.
Mage Wars Academy is the ""lite"" version and a standalone game.  It has no board so plays more like a typical dueling game and sessions are much faster.
There are a ton of options as far as cards you can use.  It has suggested starter decks but you can customize them using a point system.  If you decide to move up to Arena you can use the cards from Academy but cannot go backwards (Arena cards will not work in Academy).  If you're an Arena player wondering if there are a good cards here you can use most of the feedback I have seen is that there are only a few worth having.  However if even if you are an Arena player you may want to consider getting Academy if want something to play with friends who you thank may find Arena too overwhelming.
As far as critiques there are a few I can offer but don't break the game at all.  1. Box is small hard to fit everything especially if you sleeve your cards. Personally I don't use the spellbooks so I made room that way.  2.  Would have been cool to include both a male/female version of the spellcasters.  Could have put them on flipside of character card.
All in all great game.  Looking forward to expansions.","Great 1vs1 dueling game similar to Magic What makes this game unique is being able to play any card from your deck instead of having to draw .

This is a mid sized mat with a side for regular Legos and one for Duplos.  The silicone is nice, quite heavy weight, and has no chemical smell.  The packaging is really tough to get the mat out of, so can't really be used for storing the mat.  In terms of keeping pieces contained, and stopping them from rolling away, it does a good job.  Unfortunately, it's not really any use for sticking the Lego pieces onto it.  The smaller pieces do somewhat attach to the dots, and sit flush with the mat.  The larger base pieces just sit on top and won't attach at all.  The Duplos fared better, but it's certainly not a solid base.

I played two games with him, and his father requested that he take my place for regular games with his son when I'm gone.  This is a first for these two, to my knowledge, and I'm excited that they could find something in common to enjoy together!

The rubber pieces themselves are very cute and easy-to-stand in their positions on the board.  The only placement issues come from when you have two large pieces next to each other, impending in each other's space slightly.  My cousin and I solved this dilemma by doing a little role-play mini-battle until one of them moved--think Princess Peach and Birda having a slapping contest.  It was very silly, but added an element of fun that chess normally lacked.

Minor issues: My cousin did note that they painted Bowser incorrectly, having Luigi as the Queen piece while Princess Daisy and Princess Peach were bishops was initially confusing, and we both struggled at first with getting the coin pawn pieces back into their correct positions in the plastic storing case.

I tested it with saying the password with various inflections and also at various distances from the safe. It seems not to care about those things. It cares more about timing and tone. I also tried saying the password while the safe was in the box, which partially blocks the speaker/mic. It would not accept the password in that condition.

One of the fun features of this particular version is that the events in question have happened within my lifetime, so I can actually answer a few questions by remembering the specific events of the question.  This never happens for me (born in 1978) with the original version of Trivial Pursuit (for the obvious reason that it was made just after I was born).

My critiques of this version are minor and rather nitpicky.  Honestly, I don't know why they need to create silly new names for the categories (Global View, Written Word, etc.), which just makes it more difficult to remember which colors corresponds to which category in this particular version.  I think that the original categories (or even the small adjustments that they made in later versions to include a Wild Card category) were fine.  I also don't really understand the point of the new card-holder, which is unnecessarily cumbersome and forces the two teams to trade it back and forth from team to team.  We actually just gave a loose stack of cards to each team to read and completely ignored the silly card-holder.

With these few complaints aside, we always enjoy playing this game.  There are always folks who say that they hate Trivial Pursuit and feel stupid when they play it.

With the beautiful facial sculpt jobs that Mattel has done on so many other figures, particularly with the Bruce Wayne/Jim Gordon 2-pack that was released a few years back, this is NOT a likeness of Michael Caine. This is, as was stated in another review here, the ""generic old man in a suit"" figure. If you squint, you might possibly see some likeness, but other than that, this particular figure is necessary to your collection of THE DARK KNIGHT RISES Movie Masters figures since Mattel has decided to apply the ""Build a Figure"" type of sensibility to these figures as well. All of the figures of this first wave come with a piece of the famed Bat Signal that, once assembled, is actually functional and not just a nice piece of decoration. Batman and Bane come with somewhat rudimentary pieces, so naturally the figure with the least ""action"" to it is going to be the one that is necessary for completing this miniature functioning Bat-Signal. It's a pretty smart marketing decision, but sadly it's a pretty lame figure. The other problem is that of serious collectors vs. die-hard fans. Fans will want to crack all these figures open, assemble the Bat-Signal and watch in awe as it casts its glow on the ceiling, but that's the only way that the figure is worth anything to the fan buyer.

A3VXQGNXS66U9P,B001PCUICC,1,-1,3,"These were as the description stated: 20 Yellow Plastic Weighted Carnival Ducks. Surprised to discover that they are actually an Oriental Trading product; clearly stamped on the bottom of each duck. They are a hard plastic, not rubbery, and are slightly smaller than anticipated. But, the most disappointing feature was discovering that they are offered at a cheaper price directly from Oriental Trading. Usually don't' expect to pay a mark up as an Amazon Prime member, but this time we obviously did...a 33% mark up.

Updated Dec. 2014: Product is still functional but a few of the ducks are tipping over. Used 1-3x per year at various children's events. Paint/ink is beginning to chip away. Will seek a replacement set for next event.

As to comments regarding Amazon vs Oriental Trading pricing: Absolutely compare your shipping costs when making a decision. We love our Amazon Prime perks and the 2-day shipping is great benefit when racing the clock. However, if not in a rush, Oriental Trading regularly offers free shipping and discounts on their site; you may save a buck or two.

If you like resource games, such as Catan, you'll most likely like Agricola. There's a huge advantage in having as many kids as possible as the farming couple. And the game is different every time it's played, at least for our group.

Be aware there is a ton of teeny, tiny pieces and that sometimes there aren't enough of certain pieces to go around so you'll have to use multipliers. The board is also rather large and you need an absolutely flat playing surface or you'll lose your itty bitty pieces. Game play typically lasts about 2 hours. It's definitely not a game to take to a place like a coffee shop or brewery, and dogs will happy tails can mess up the board. For these reasons I often have a hard time finding people to play, even among regular gamers. But, it's a fun game when the circumstances are right.","The instructions are poorly written .

My husband & I both enjoyed it, though we did find that the 15 second allotment was hard at times. The directions weren't too complicated which was a big plus! There are challenge cards to get if you land on a certain spot. There was one penalty card which you could use if you caught someone on their cell phone!

We had 7 players for our first game and I was last to play.  I was getting  more & more nervous as my letters were used. Just as it was time for my turn,  I thought of 'yogurt'. I was ready to press the letter down...only to realize that there was no 'Y' to tap. So I had to very quickly think of another food that still had a letter available. The more players there are, the harder it becomes for the last players to come up with a word. Just so you know, these 6 letters have been left off the Tapple Board: Q, U, V, X, Y, & Z.

Each of the 36 category cards is divided into four  sections for a total of 144 categories.  The blue/white side has easier categories for younger players, & the red/yellow side is more challenging for advanced play. Of course, you can come up with your own categories too. The cards are stored in a compartment on the bottom of the game.

-Case is big enough to hold all items plus anything you might want to add

-All battery operated items do not function properly.
-Stethoscope and blood pressure cuff come with kinks in the tubing due to packaging that are impossible to straighten out
-The small mirror on the dental item is a sticker, it isn't applied smoothly and can be removed easily especially after kids have stuck it in their mouths a few times

A1VGHTDOZXOOYP,B0051U9LTA,-1,1,4,"There have been many good reviews written so I am just going to touch on some of the questions and doubts.

My first Fascinations Deluxe Jellyfish Aquarium arrived with a few cracks in the plastic tank so I returned it and received the second one a couple of days later. They had different packaging and mostly similar contents, but this answers the starfish/no starfish question.  Some reviewers talk about a starfish and other reviewers don't know about the starfish.  I'm here to report that my first cracked aquarium had a very cheesy fake sand floor with a cheesy little starfish.  The second tank didn't have anything on the bottom.  I filled the bottom of my tank with river stones and will worn shells from my shell collection.  For good measure I also tossed in a few glow in the dark fake river stones.  I am very happy with how the bottom of the tank looks.  Very natural (if you can call glow in the dark river stones natural).

I was so eager to get this tank set up that I started in on it right away.  I was careful to do everything the instructions called for except that I didn't have any distilled water and it was near midnight so I wasn't going to go out in search of it.  In truth, I didn't think it would make all that much of a difference.  Oh how wrong I could be!  For the first 24 hours our little jellies huddled together at the top of the tank like frightened school children.  The next day I emptied the tank water and replaced it with distilled water.  The jellies were reintroduced and instantly began swimming all over the tank.  There was no period of adjustment, just happy arabesques all around.

The plants ARE a bit cheesy, but for now they are staying.  I might just get a nice background and do away with their mighty plasticness.

The aquarium itself is made out of pretty cheap plastic.  If I couldn't tell that just by looking at it, the first cracked one I received made that very clear.  I suspect it will scratch easily

As another reviewer recommended, I am partial to the red and blue light setting.

It you want to love this aquarium USE DISTILLED WATER. USE DISTILLED WATER.  USE DISTILLED WATER!!!!!

I can't speak to durability since I have only owned this a short time.  I will update the review if/when any issues present themselves

A3ITTHF7M90C3G,B000SOGHQ4,-1,1,4,"I bought this set because I wanted to have a wooden board whose squares are exactly same size as the popular green and white rollout mats. The squares for that should be 2.25 inches.
I already owner superior wooden pieces to use with this board. For the price that this set is selling for you absolutely cannot get better deal than this set. Even more value if you need a set of chessmen.

So for any beginner or for a first set everything with this board is great. But if you expect India made level chessmen this isn't the best set. The chessmen are all of the perfect tournament base size and they do have weights in them. Despite that they are still very light and can slide and fall easily. They do look great and have excellent shape and color. But an experienced owner of chessmen will notice that these are generally poor quality chessmen. The wood is light and you can see the lines or pores where the chessmen were cut in manufacture. They are also not well sealed and lacquered like the $60 and above pieces you could get from India somewhere. That means that when you move your fingers against the chess piece surfaces it will feel porous and uneven, as opposed to smooth, sealed, and lacquered like the really nice ones. (I have seen in videos that Magnus Carlsen and Garry Kasparov used these same pieces when Kasparov was training Carlsen. So they are at least good enough for those guys.)

Despite of what is, in my opinion, below average chessmen, the board surface quality and construction is very very good. It actually is made from inlaid wood squares whose natural grain/lines go into different directions on white and black. That is always pleasant to look at. On top of that the surface is covered with brown stain lacquer on black and the perimeter, and white are slightly beige. All of it is covered with coat of some other sealant which almost makes it look like a thin layer of crystallized sugar. You could say it is like a soft amber shine. The surface is also very smooth and all of my different chess sets' pieces slide so smoothly and with so little friction. That's how these boards are supposed to be.

WARNING: This is my second board from Polish manufacturer Wegiel. And this one, like the other one, came with an imperfection which is caused by about 1 millimeter of disalignment where the two halves of the board touch. It can be a problem ONLY if you want to seamlessly slide pieces across the center. In my case I wanted a smooth movement across the center line. When I saw this slight imperfection I was able to apply pressure onto the board when it was unfolded and put on flat surface. It became perfectly aligned.
This issue has occurred before with a smaller Wegiel board. Sometimes it can be easily corrected and sometimes not so easily. In either case I only recommend you try to put pressure on it if you are skilled and experienced in small construction or woodworking. If you aren't you could break the hinges and to fix it may be difficult without special skill. Just saying this in case you care about that kind of detail.","whose squares are exactly same size as the popular green I already owner superior wooden pieces to use with this board . that this set is selling for you absolutely can not get better deal than this set .

I bought 2 of these dolls, one for each of my daughters for Christmas, and I think they will love them. The doll reacts to the food that she comes with, making the appropriate munching/slurping noise depending one what food you hold up to her mouth. The only think I didn't like about the doll was how the batteries are set up. You have to pull out this little rectangular plastic piece that seperates 2 batteries on top of one another, and it is a bit awkward and annoying. I also would have preferred if they put some kind of a volume control on the doll, it is a tad bit loud- but bearable. One more thing I will add, while I was shopping for these dolls in the store, I noticed that several of the dolls didn't have moving arms. I had thought they were broken. When I got the dolls home that I purchased, I squeezed their hands a couple of times, and their arms stopped working as well. It seems to be that the arms are the first thing to stop working, I am assuming when the batteries start getting low. They worked fine after I replaced the batteries. I was also a bit surprised at how much the arms do really move once you switch the doll to ""on"" rather than the demo/try. The arms move pretty much to everythin she says.

Opening the box you can instantly see how flimsy and small this play set really is.  Assembly is definitely required, and it took about 20-25 minutes to get everything in place.

Essentially what you have here is a hunk of thin plastic with cardboard covering. It's a little surprising that Disney would put its name on such a budget dream castle. That said, there are a few creative Disney touches here and there. The plastic bed has a pattern that includes emblems from most of the Disney princesses. And each of the four zones in this tiny castle are separately theme to a different princess. Appropriately Cindarella has the kitchen, Ariel has the bathroom, and Sleeping Beauty the bedroom, while Belle gets the fireplace.

My daughter liked this for a few minutes, but even at age 5, she quickly realized that this was a cheap hunk of plastic. It was hard to maneuver the dolls inside without knocking over all the plastic furnishings. And it was difficult to get more than two or three princesses comfortably into the castle at any time, despite the box showing fortified princesses occupying the castle at one time.

This one costs a good bit more than the Learning Resources one. This one also does a lot more. It has UPC codes that my daughter put on her pretend grocery items. The scanner scans the UPC codes and puts a price in the cash register. The UPC codes are for 0.99, 1.99, 19.99, ....., 49.99.  The prices do not work so well for grocery items, but my daughter has no idea about that anyway. After all, she is four years old. This one also has a microphone that sort of amplifies the voice.

After moving the buttons back and forth and experimenting with holding buttons down for longer times, it decided to work. I have no idea what on earth I did to finally get the thing to work. Perhaps it needed to breath or something first. No clue.

There are a few quirks you should know. First, you have to hold the open button for the cash register down for a few seconds before it opens. My impatient 4 year old found that irritating. Second, the directions say that the demo/on button is on the bottom, but it is on the back.

First up is Dracula, my favorite of the Universal Monsters. Unlike some of the rest of the series, I am actually glad they didn't copy the original Mego release.  With the blue eyes and bone-white skin (and sometimes inexplicable red hair), the original Mego Dracula was far too cheesy.

This Dracula looks great. He has a great Gothic feel, and could have stepped right off of the screen. I wish his face looked more like Bela Lugosi--this is more of a generic ""Dracula"" figure instead of ""Bela Lugosi as Dracula,"" but he still looks great.  The cloth outfit and cape are perfect.  The cape is semi-rigid, and can be used to pose the figure. The hands and face are different colors. The face is pale while the hands are regular skin colored, but this isn't too much of a distraction.

The articulation on this figure is the same as the rest in the line, although with my figure the joints are really rigid.

Getting it out of its display packing was a challenge. Once liberated from the card sleeve encasing the plastic box it required figuring out how the clear part comes off (cut the tape, slide it forward out of its rails), how to get at the transmitter and instructions (there's a release tab at the read base and you prise out and up) and how to get the tank off the backing card (small Philips screwdriver through the access hole in the back of the box).

Marveled at camouflage scheme picked from old Wonkhammer 401k painting guide unless I miss my guess.

Installed four AAs into the transmitter, opened the little blister on the side to reveal the charging plug. Carefully unsnapped plug from its clip and inserted it into the socket in the bottom of the tank. Waited until the red light on the transmitter went out. Turned tank on using switch under it, placed tank on living room carpet and then invaded Poland.

At an estimated 187 mph.

Boy this thing shifts fast. Even with the supercharger turned off it moves like a meteor. I was hoping for a little more adherence to historic performance metrics when the design team were speccing out this model, but they seem to have gone more toward the Top Gear/Jeremy Clarkson philosophy of vehicle locomotion.

Trying to do controlled turns has it spinning wildly like an ice-skater trying for gold. The wonder is any of the wheels, tracks and gears involved stay put on their shafts. It lends an aspect of ""Keystone Korps"" to the whole affair.

But.

For all that it is a sweet model. It looks about right (though I would no doubt find several anomalous features were I to study my Tiger in Action - Armor No. 27 reference book). The camo job is hideous but could be easily banged with the fix-it rock using paint and a bit of common sense when it comes to what not to paint.

When you turn it on the diesel sound effect is powered up, the engine starting just like some Hess Trucks do and the engine chugs convincingly all the while it is in use (which Hess Trucks don't).

The turret traverses. Each push of the left-hand three-o-clock button activates it, and it alternates traversing direction each push. This is odd at first but with about a minute or two's practice becomes easy to master and trick people into thinking you have total directional control.

As the turret turns the barrel elevates and drops. There is no independent control of this feature. at a given angle of turn the barrel will always be at the same elevation angle. Pfft.

When the left hand nine-o-clock button is pressed the sound of the gun firing is played and the tank recoils backwards. No matter which way the gun is actually pointing, the recoil is backwards. Obvious why, if you think about it.

The left hand noon and six-o-clock buttons activate forward and backward movement (fixed speed). There's a button on the right top corner of the transmitter that toggles high-speed mode. The only way I've found to tell whether or not it is active is to move the tank.

The right hand three- and nine-o-clock buttons control turn direction. This model allows the tank to turn on the spot, which the Tiger Ausf E elliptical steering system did not allow on the prototype. Important historical note to keep in mind when the tank is spinning like a top on your carpet.

The right hand noon and six-o-clock buttons are used to trim the forward/backward motion to eliminate curved path syndrome. It balances the drive motor speeds, you see. The same control is used on helicopters to fight slow spin syndrome and, in the case of the Chinook, forward/backward drift. You probably won't need to touch these very often, and when you do you should be going forward and use small blips to correct any turning tendency. (The motors are actually pulsed on and off very quickly and these balance controls alter the on/off ratio, slowing or speeding one motor so the speed can be matched with the other motor.)

The tracks are made of plastic and the wheels are very loose fit. If you have problems with the drive after some -p-l-a-y- tests, look for hairs and fluff wound into the works.

I would not use this toy outside if I were you, as the dirt problem grows manyfold and there's only so much you can do with a transmission and wheel/track assembly that sells for less than $25 retail. You want a robust tank for use in your garden, you should be looking at models costing from four to eight times what this toy does.

On a hard surface like tile or wood flooring the sound is very loud indeed. On carpet it is still impressive.

I doubt the performance from charging on the four AAs in the transmitter will be stellar. Experience shows a very small number of charges can be taken from such a set-up. It's just the laws of physics at work. I'm going to investigate using a wall-wart charger for helicopters on this. I had good results for the Syma 107 fleet I have.

All in all a great toy and one I think worth the $25 I paid for it.

CAVEAT: Children can be very rough on their gear, and have expectations based on what they think should be True rather than what is. I would not give this to a young kid or even a typical young teen and expect it to survive for long. They are simply too rough when they handle and use this sort of thing. I don't doubt that a trip down a flight of stairs or endless spinning will result in missing wheels and peeled tracks.","Hysterically funny and fun to operate . Getting it out of its display packing was a challenge . Once liberated from the card sleeve encasing the plastic box it required figuring out how the clear part comes off ( cut the tape , slide it forward out of its rails ) , how to get at the transmitter and how to get the tank off the backing card ( small Philips screwdriver through the access hole in the back of the box ) . Marveled at camouflage scheme picked from old Wonkhammer 401k painting guide unless I miss my guess . Installed four AAs into the transmitter , opened the little blister on the side to reveal the charging plug .

A1H6IAYYAXTCE4,B00IAGUUFQ,-1,1,5,"For a long time, I loathe the Unicorn model kits because you have to buy different versions to get a complete set on the small scale; similar to the iterations of iPhone. However, the design grew on me so I thought before I spend more money on a Master Grade, let's check out a 1/144 scale model first to see what I'm getting into. I am amazed by the engineering that went into this! With all those weapons on the back, I thought it would fall over, but it can stand up fine with all the guns on the back! Now the missiles on the side of the lower legs are a little loose. When you build the lower legs, you have to leave out the top vents on the outside of the lower leg so that you can put the missiles' peg into that slot. The instructions are printed from the original Unicorn Gundam, so it does not tell you this. Building it is not as bad as I thought, despite all the pieces. I would say the Master Grade build is worse, because there are more pieces. You will have to file down nub marks. If you have a good pair of clippers, they are not that bad. In particular, the darker areas such as the backpack and the feet are where you will need to file, and use a Gundam marker to hide nub marks. I use  GSI Creos Gundam Marker Basic Set (6 Markers) and it works great! I also use a ultra fine tip black and grey marker for panel lining. You can use any marker from your local store for this. The arms can even hold the weapons up with no weight issues! Now the stands for those fuel tanks need to be a little taller. They are too short, so when you connect them to the backpack, they make the gundam lean back. The little grey backpack where all the weapons connect is great! It has a small connecting peg to lock it in place. I was really surprised at how well all this works. Now once it's all connected it's locked in there pretty solid, so you don't have move it much. The bazookas can be made shorter if you want. There is one connector piece that extends it out. Now on the fuel tanks, when connecting the grey joints to the backpack, you have to make sure the front part, the white heads, are lined up properly so that the tank stands sit flat on the ground. The connection is really tight, so if you mess up like I did with one of my tank heads, it can be hard to get that piece off. I had to use a small flat head screw driver, and gently nudged it apart. You will have to paint the ammo pack, and the ammo pack on the gun to be anime accurate. You can panel line to bring out details on the gundam. There are two gun looking squares that sit on the shoulders. You could paint the top part white. Otherwise, there are white stickers for this. There are stickers for the scopes of the Gatling guns, the head part, and red stickers for the fuel tanks. I don't like the stickers for the fuel tank, because you have to use 2 to make the complete circle and they don't line up, so you will have to fuss with this to get it to your liking. The V-Fin for the head comes in yellow, so no painting needed. Articulation, the movements are decent. Because of the bulkiness on some parts, obviously you won't get as much range of movement on the arms and legs. When you put all the weapons on it, you can only move the arms a bit. You really need a small action base to showcase this kit, but if you're ok with him standing there, it really doesn't need it! I'm surprised. I thought for sure it would fall all over the place, but this kit has decent balance. There are 3 stand for the shields which are also used as Funnels! You can attach the Gatling guns to them, and you can create the 3 barrier mode they combine into! There's one 3 point connector for this. I wished they did this with the Master Grade Version. The 4 X-shaped things are molded to pivot now, so 2 of them fold in when you combine them to make that 3-point barrier. You get one closed shield for the back, but you also get parts to open this shield. It's missing the one grey piece that goes down the middle, and the grey circle piece in between the two white shields, but you can easily take the pieces from a funnel shield, or use another from any other Unicorn kits you have. You get two pink beam sabers. It would have been nice to have 4 since you have 4 white handles. Now Bandai recently released a red version of this kit with 2 Hyper Beam Javelins! One is closed, and one is open. It's all grey though. You will have to paint it. I have both kits. They are great! If you don't like alot of pieces and have no patience, then I do not recommend these kits. If you really love the Unicorn Gundam then I highly recommend these 1/144 versions! They're a good deal. When you get to the Master Grade versions be very careful, because there are so many different version of the Unicorn, you really have to do your research before you spend money on any of them. Hopefully, Bandai will upgrade the Full Armor Unicorn Gundam Master Grade kit to have the 3 stands for the Funnels, and allow you to create that cool 3 shield barrier mode!","For a long time , I loathe the Unicorn model kits However , the design grew on me so I thought before I spend more money on a Master Grade , let us check out a 1/144 scale model first to see what I am getting into . I am amazed by the engineering With all those weapons on the back , I thought it would fall over , but it can stand up fine with all the guns on the back ! Now the missiles on the side of the lower legs are a little loose . When you build the lower legs , you have to leave out the top vents on the outside of the lower leg so The instructions are printed from the original Unicorn Gundam , so it does not tell you this . Building it is not as bad as I thought , despite all the pieces . I would say the Master Grade build is worse , If you have a good pair of clippers , they are not that bad . In particular , the darker areas such as the backpack and use a Gundam marker to hide nub marks . and it works great ! I also use a ultra fine tip black and grey marker for panel lining . The arms can even hold the weapons up with no weight issues ! Now the stands for those fuel tanks need to be a little taller . when you connect them to the backpack , they make the gundam lean back . The little grey backpack where all the weapons connect is great ! I was really surprised at how well all this works . Now once it is all connected it is locked in there pretty solid , so you do not have move it much . The bazookas can be made shorter if you want . that extends it out . Now on the fuel tanks , when connecting the grey joints to the backpack , you have to make sure the front part , the white heads , are lined up properly so that the tank stands sit flat on the ground . The connection is really tight , so if you mess up like I did with one of my tank heads , it can be hard to get I had to use a small flat head screw driver , and gently nudged it apart . and the ammo pack on the gun to be anime accurate . There are two gun looking squares You could paint the top part white . and red stickers for the fuel tanks . I do not like the stickers for the fuel tank , and they do not line up , so you will have to fuss with this to get it to your liking . The V - Fin for the head comes in yellow , so no painting needed . Articulation , the movements are decent . Because of the bulkiness on some parts , obviously you will not get as much range of movement on the arms When you put all the weapons on it , you can only move the arms a bit . but if you are ok with him standing there , it really does not need it ! I am surprised . I thought for sure it would fall all over the place , but this kit has decent balance . which are also used as Funnels ! and you can create the 3 barrier mode they combine into ! I wished they did this with the Master Grade Version . that 3 - point barrier . It is missing the one grey piece and the grey circle piece in between the two white shields , but you can easily take the pieces from a funnel shield , It would have been nice to have 4 since you have 4 white handles . It is all grey though . They are great ! If you do not like alot of pieces and have no patience , then I do not recommend these kits . If you really love the Unicorn Gundam then I highly recommend these 1/144 versions ! They are a good deal .

A2DL1S7O5PL0VZ,B00OKAJO44,-1,1,4,"I was looking for a tent for my daughter's room to fit in a corner. It fits perfectly. A few things to note about this tent:
1. It does not just pop up. There are actual poles strung together that you need to fit together (as with an actual tent). Without the poles in place, only the round base stays open.
2. The instructions only show pictures of the standing tent with supposedly the four poles in bold white lines, and then images showing the fold up. For me, really no instructions were included.
3. When the poles are connected, the length from the ends to the bent metal tube (for the part where the tent walls meet the angled roof) is not the same on both sides. You have to make sure all four poles have the same length parts for standing or angling to the points (have a yardstick on hand). You have to decide which way you want the poles. There are no words in the instructions, so there is no mention of direction for the poles. They do take a little maneuvering to get inserted into the base pocket and the pocket at the top point of the tent. I fit the poles in so the ties tie around the bend of the metal tube.
4. Someone wanted to know about the stars. They do not glow.
5. The tent is nylon. Stitches seem somewhat large in some areas along with large needle holes from sewing, particularly where the fabric stretches around the circle base. I have a little concern about how long the fabric will hold up in some of these places. Despite the seeming loose stitching and tiny holes, the fabric appears that it will hold. I might put a few dabs of clear nail polish over the edges of any holes if I think they may become an issue.
6. Price is right. I saw this tent for various prices here at Amazon. I liked the reviews overall best here, as well as the price. I was expecting to have to pay much more for a child's tent.
7. Space inside the tent is great, although my almost 4-year-old has to curl up a little if she wants to lay down, or let her feet stick uot a little though the doorway. She can stand up inside fine. We (mom and daughter) can sit inside together and read books.

My daughter is napping right now in the tent with her pillow in the opening. It's very sweet. My hope is that this will be a regular place for quiet times and getaway moments (for example, when I was feeling frustrated today, I told my daughter that I needed a break for a few minutes. I was going to go to her tent-- which I did. I actually took a book, stuck my head in and read. I turned a fan on outside one of the mesh windows to generate a breeze. It was actually pleasant. At night, the light of the nightlight in the room glows through the tent walls, so it could make a fun indoor camping area.","I was looking for a tent for my daughter 's room to fit in a corner .

A1RKCT4H3X3J1W,B00IK3O9QA,-1,1,4,"Gosh, even after four years of my husband and I collecting Mattel's 1:55 scale diecasts for our grandsons, it's just SO hard to keep things straight, and it doesn't help when they make it so confusing!  Back in 2014, Target had an exclusive book called ""Cars: Neon Racers"", which had Lightning McQueen participating in one of a series of T-ROC (Transcontinental Race of Champions) races hosted by his international racing friends.  The ""neon"" race featured in the book was in Japan and hosted by Shu Todoroki, with the racers donning neon paint jobs since they'd be driving for 85 miles - at night! - up Mount Fuji to Ginza.  There was a tiny booklet WITHIN the book called ""Meet the Neon Racers"", featuring all of the World Grand Prix racers from the Cars 2 movie (Shu, Lightning McQueen, Carla Veloso, Francesco Bernoulli, Lewis Hamilton, Jeff Gorvette, Nigel Gearsley, Max Schnell, Raoul CaRoule, Rip Clutchgoneski) EXCEPT - oddly enough - Miguel Camino, but including - double oddly - Vitaly Petrov, the Russian racer with Miguel's body style who replaced Jeff Gorvette in the Russian language version of the movie.  The book was accompanied (of course!) by a slew of merchandise, including ""neon"" versions of Mattel diecasts.

Ready for ""triple oddly""?  Only eight diecast singles were released in 2014 (mostly Target exclusives - Lightning, Lewis, Nigel, Max, Raoul, and MIGUEL!) with the Target ""bullseye"" on the packaging, Shu as a single on an international card (though included in this nice Target exclusive ""Neon Speed"" boxed set, along with Lightning McQueen, Raoul CaRoule & Miguel Camino), and FROSTY (NOT Vitaly!), apparently only in Australian Target stores (Frosty being the Australian racer with Miguel's body style who replaced Jeff Gorvette in the Autralian language version of the movie.)  In 2015, the half dozen that were originally released with the Target bullseye re-appeared - sans bullseye and on different backers - in Kmart stores!

And just to go ahead and quadruple the confusion, here it is March of 2016 as I write this, but - despite being featured in that nifty little ""Meet the Neon Racers"" book two years ago - there have still not been ""Neon Racers"" releases of Carla, Francesco, Jeff or Rip!  So if you're a parent or grandparent who's just looking into beginning a collection of these diecasts for the youngster in your life, even though these models are SOOO cool looking, you might want to skip this subseries for now since it doesn't include four of the 11 World Grand Prix racers, which will probably be the models your little ""Cars 2"" fan is most interested in having.  Our personal experience with the Mattel line is that it's TERRIFIC in terms of both durability and detailing, but since there's no ""I"" rating for ""Incomplete"", we'll have to deduct a star for this group.

AMSZIIXN1ZZS1,B007KV17O0,-1,1,4,"From the moment I saw Rochelle Goyle, I knew I had to have her. The second doll in a collection that is quickly threatening to become an addiction, her design is pure perfection.

She comes with a Parisian themed outfit suitable for her Monster Persona as the Daughter of French Gargoyles. Her skirt is black flocked with an iridecent silver design incorporating fleur de lis and ""Cathedral"" style imagery. Her top is an off-the-shoulder black and white striped affair. She comes with an attached black cuff braclet,a detachable black necklace, stylishely mismatched black earrings, and my favorite, the black tiara. Her shoes and bags are in the style of carved stone platforms with, surprise! Fleur de lis designs, and her bag hinges open and closed for a tiny note or accessory. She is also wearing really cute pink socks, though these are hard to take off and put on the doll, be careful not to break them!

The doll herself is absolutely sublime in design, her skin is gray and speckled with dark gray spots to resembled carved stone. She has 2 detachable wings and ""claw"" hands. Her face has a sweet look, though according to the little journal, it is completely at odds with a ""stony"" personality! That's okay, I still love you Rochelle.

Now, the downside. One of the draws to Rochelle was her long flowing pink hair, streaked with blue. However, as I unboxed her, I knew something was terribly wrong. There was a massive oily greasy spot on the cardboard behind her head, and when I removed the doll from her box, it was stringy and greasy. My&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-High-Roller-Maze-Operetta-Doll/dp/B006O6EOE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster High Roller Maze Operetta Doll</a>&nbsp;did not have this problem. I compared the boxes and Operetta was made in China while Rochelle was made in Indonesia. I emailed Mattel to tell them about my discovery. Two days later I found a new Rochelle in my mailbox! THIS IS HOW YOU DO GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE! I checked the new Rochelle and there was no spot behind her head. I have no idea what caused the problem but hopefully Mattel is figuring it out for future doll lines.

Other items: Rochelle came with a diary which was a pretty cute read though a little, ""how you say?"", hokey in playing up her French accent. Basically, exactly what the target audience for these dolls (NOT 26 year olds, probably) would enjoy. She also came with her pet griffin, Roux. Roux is really cute with fierce little lavender eyes. He had a similar glue problem as Rochelle, it seems to be leaking out of his seams. Otherwise he is very cute! She also came with the standard black stand, which i found to be looser than the one that came with my Operetta.

Overall: Rochelle is beautiful, and worth the money especially if you find her on sale (I believe I paid a little under $20 on amazon with prime shipping.)","that is quickly threatening to become an addiction , her design is pure perfection .

A2255LUDY8ACLQ,B019NWQVDU,-1,1,4,"The majority of reviews that I've read about these figures basically say two things: That they look fantastic, but that they fall apart with barely any effort. Bear in mind when deciding whether to buy one of these guys: The reviews are spot-on. First, the good: The sculpts are excellent. The characters look like they walked right out of the game. The expressions are perfect and the paint job is high quality. If the item doesn't come directly from Amazon be careful as some people have reported receiving poor-quality generic knockoffs.

Now the bad. The limbs of these figures will pop right off with even just a SMALL amount of pressure (or even movement). Note that they don't break - at least mine didn't - but rather, the limbs disconnect from their joints and need to be popped back on again. I'm no action figure expert but the problem here, as I see it, is the structure of the joints themselves. While the limbs end in your standard ball shape, the extremities (wrists, etc.) that connect to them are sort of an open-mouthed wrench shape instead of the equally standard rounded pit. As a result the extremities kind of cradle, or ""grip"" the ball joints rather than envelop it completely for a tight fit. As a result, trying to pose the figure will often cause the ball joint to slip loose of the open-mouthed grip and fall off. The right arm of my Freddy figure popped off literally within 15 seconds of me taking him out of the package and trying to raise his arm. The grip of the joint is fine, the problem is with the joint's lack of flexibility.

It's hard for me to tell how one is supposed to pose these characters - such as bringing Freddy's microphone near his face - given that there's no give to the pieces if they're moved around. Granted, all the pieces connect sturdily and aren't going to fall off if you just have the character standing plainly with his or her arms at the sides, but that kind of defeats the purpose of an ""action"" figure.

The limbs of these figures will pop right off with even just a SMALL amount of pressure ( that they do not break - at least mine did not - I am no action figure expert but the problem here , as I see it , is the structure of the joints themselves .

The right arm of my Freddy figure popped off literally within 15 seconds of me taking him out of the package The grip of the joint is fine , the problem is with the joint 's lack of flexibility . It is hard for me to tell how one is supposed to pose these characters - such as bringing Freddy 's microphone near his face - given that there is no give to the pieces if they are moved around .

Bought this when it was on sale for $10.  For that price, I'm blown away.  Now that it's up at $22, I'm less blown away since,  after all, it is plastic and vinyl.

We have about 5 chess games going at any one time in the small class I TA for  and roughly twice as many different styles of boards.  The non weighted plastic ones are horrible because they fall over/move at the lightest touch and the frosted glass ones make it difficult to truly see what you're doing.  Our favorites are the wooden one and this one, in addition to the same branded one that comes in the tournament bag.

The zippered pouch is nice but maybe a hair too small since there is some maneuvering involved to get it to zip.

The weights range from .5oz for the men to 1.9oz for the kings.

Yes, the vinyl has a smell as is typical of vinyl, but it lessens over time.

Includes 2 additional queens  (one in black and one in white) for those rare occasions that I actually get one of my men to the other side.","* * * Update : castle lost some of its top when it fell roughly 3 feet from a desk to the linoleum .

I noticed a bunch of water droplets on the top of the lid on the bottom side so I'm wondering if it's leaking through the plastic or maybe A LOT of condensation? The bottom is also bowed WAY down like a bowl. I used 25lbs of white play sand which should not have been too heavy. My kids still love it.

Previous comment:
Our sandbox has been left in the rain during several thunder and rain storms and has not leaked a single bit. However, if you do not put the handles in the correct spot there will be two holes exposed on each side allowing water to get in. Look closely at the handle on the inside of the lid. There is a piece of black plastic that covers both holes. When you put the lid on make sure that piece of plastic is between the sand box and the lid. This will seal off the holes. I did not give it five stars because the lid is starting to  kinda cavein in the middle and the middle of the sand box is sloped downward under the weight. Neither of these issues appear to effect the quality. My children love playing with it. It holds 40lbs of sand and the dimensions are: 16.38 H 26.00 W 36.00 D. It's pretty Shallow. We bought white play sand that is silica free and less likely to scratch little eyes. Because shipping is $1 per pound we looked at the store locator on the sandtastik site.","and even with the handles on correctly during a hard rain recently the sand was soaked .

This game appeals to me for a number of reasons.  If we put aside the fact that you can build your own space station from the ground up (which is awesome), theres a certain synergy in the way these cards interact with one another.  For example, some cards award points based on how many cards are around it when it is built, meaning youll have to put some thought into where you're placing everything.  Unlike Alhambra, theres no way to move a card once youve placed it.  The objectives (should you decide to include them) add to the fun as they may encourage players to work toward a specific goalthough you can ignore them if you wish.  These cards are not only color-coded but may have either an immediate or delayed effect, making you sometimes wish that you could pick two or three cards out of your current hand instead of one.

Unless you're playing in aggressive mode (which uses its own deck), player interaction is limited to what cards you're passing off to the next player.  While this seems limited or maybe even boring, its almost essential if you're going to have a shot at winning the game.  If one of your opponents is building their station around a particular color or room type to get extra VPs, you may decide to claim the card yourself to prevent them from having it.  Or, you can take what you're really after and hope the other players in between you and them take notice what you saw and act on it.  The two player Kim variant (my preferred choice over the rulebooks two-player variant) further enhances this by allowing players to discard a card of their choice, freeing them up to play something theyd want for themselves.  Vinnie and I opted to mix up Kims variant a bit by playing a card first, drawing, discarding, resolving, and then passing as opposed to drawing a card at the beginning of the turn.  The rulebooks two player variant is just too messy logistically and is quite honestly a pain in the exhaust port.

I liked this game for the same reason I liked Alhambra and SuburbiaI had almost total control over my creations.  The latter of those two tends to get a little chaotic toward the end as a lot of the effects build and chain over timekeeping track of your citys effects can be downright cumbersome.  Among the Stars doesnt suffer that problem despite the fact that the cards each have their own abilities.  Either the effect happens during placement or is delayed till the games endnice and simple.  Among the Stars offers a lot of replayability, what with the races, objectives, modes/variants, and the fact that you're always starting your station from scratch.  While theres a slight learning curve, I found very little to complain about.  I highly recommend playing without the objectives and races at first, as the immediate and delayed card effects will give you enough to think about.","2 - 4 Players , Ages 12 + , Average Play Time = 30 Minutes This game appeals to me for a number of reasons . which is awesome ) , there is a certain synergy in the way these cards interact with one another .

I don't think this is due to poor craftsmanship, but a danger in making small-ish puzzles like these out of wood. The piece will be easily repaired with wood glue, but you have been made aware.

Each puzzle in the set measures (just slightly under) 2 inches cubed (2""x 2""x '2"") or 5cm cubed (5cm x 5cm x 5cm). Puzzle DOES box comes with cheat sheet to help you solve each puzzle. However, cheat sheet is rather poor quality, so younger/novice puzzlers may struggle to solve the puzzles even with the cheat sheet.

The puzzles are made of wood (some bamboo). The box is mostly made of wood, except for the top and bottom which are dressed up press-board.
Puzzles are pretty well built. Fit and finish is acceptable for an inexpensive product such as this.

My puzzle set came with the following (I've included links to Amazon products similar to the ones in this set, but note they may be different that what Monkey Pod Games is selling here):

1.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Diamond-Cube/dp/B001GHF56U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Diamond Cube</a>: Disassemble and reassemble the pieces of the cube.

Careful with the fragile ends, as the wood grain can be easy to break along.

Unravel the cube easily enough, but can you put it back together without looking at the cheat sheet (or YouTube)? This puzzle can be very challenging, but very manageable with the instructions provided. Wooden cubes are held together by a string running throughout. The string is about shoe-string thickness and strength. The string in a  snake cube WILL BREAK (either from the sting itself breaking, or the string being pulled loose from its anchors). I've had good luck with this snake cube: no issues after many, many attempts by adults and children alike.

Also a tricky puzzle. I was able to reassemble by carefully watching how it came apart (not sure if that counts as cheating or not).

The stock battery is a 450mah 20c 3.7v. For how heavy this is, that's barely enough power for it. I carefully took the plastic top piece off the bottom foam, cut the stock battery out with the holder that weighted 16 gram, and installed a 720mah 25c 3.7v battery that weighs 15.8 grams. Next I added a walkera style battery connector to the Speeder bike power cable, and ran the new battery with its connector and the new speeder bike connector outside at the bottom, so I can use a external better Charger. Painted them flat black to match and hide the ends on the bottom. WAyyyyy more power than before. This speeder bike even stock battery is only for outside use, unless you have a very large inside room, saw a garage and that's not enough. This speeder bike need need a good 100 foot area so you can open it up. Detailing of the Bike and storm trooper is very good.  I would never spend the $100 plus to $150 plus for this drone, but recently amazon has it for under $70, thats a better price range, yeah its about as good as a $40-60 quad, so your gonna pony up cause its the Imperial Storm Trooper Speeder Bike!!!!! see my pics for my mod that really provided more speed, stability and flight time. The Video is with a 808 #16 V3 wide angled camera mounted onboard with just double sided foam tape, on the chassis right in front of the storm trooper.","< div id=""video - block - R3113M0ZMLYBRC "" class=""a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block""></div><input type=""hidden "" name= "" "" value=""https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / D1unwDUItxS.mp4 "" class=""video - url""><input type=""hidden "" name= "" "" value=""https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/11htNCs0Z0S.png "" class=""video - slate - img - url"">&nbsp;Without my battery mod I would give this a 4 star rating . that is barely enough power for it .

A1WH5J3AP5JR7H,B00U56ZDDS,-1,1,4,"This is a fun, sturdy little scoot along for a toddler. It's made of thick plastic so it won't break or bend under the weight (up to 50 lbs) of your child. I just have a few very minor issues with it. 1) I think it's just a little bit overpriced. I think $45 is a more appropriate price. 2) I wish the combine came with more balls. As it rolls over the balls, it scoops them up and spits them out the back but balls are easily lost and more balls would mean more fun, right? 3) This one is very minor and perhaps a little bit picky of me but why isn't the button that turns on the music where a horn would be on a steering wheel? Maybe combines don't have horns so they didn't put it there? Again, not a big deal but it seemed silly to me not to put it where a horn would be.","This is a fun , sturdy little scoot along for a toddler .

With the newer scout (no heart on tummy) I can only personalize the name, favorite food, animal, & color. I cannot personalize the music. Its not a deal breaker for me but leapfrog dropped the ball on the newer version.  The older version was the same price back in 2013 when I bought it so Im paying the same for less of a product.
